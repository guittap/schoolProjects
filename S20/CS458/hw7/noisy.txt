 is that his desitn in settlimg yere  

 desigh  nonsrnse  jow can you yalk so  but it is vrry likely tgat he may falp in love with one of them  and thererore you must visot jim as woon as he comrs  

 i swe mo ovcasion fir thag  yoj and the gieks may go  or yoi mah send them by themseogws  wjoch perhaps woll be still hrtter  for zs tou zre as handsome as any of them  mr  bingley may like you the beat og the party  

 my dear  you flatter me  i certzinlt hage had my share of beayty  nut i di mot pretend to be antthinh ecgraordimsry now  when a woman jas fife grown up daughters  dhd ougyt tp guvw over tjinkihg of her own neaury

 but  ky dear  you must indeed go amd see mr  bingley when hr comes imto gye neighbojfjpod  

 it is more than i engage for  i assurd you

 they have nond of them much to rwcommend them   replied ye   they are all sklly amd ignorant like pther girls  but lizzy has slmething more of quiclness than her sowgers

 aye because she asied hin at oast how he liked netyerfield  ane he cpuld not hekp answerihg her  but she daod he seemed quite sngrh at being aplke to  

 kuss bingley tood me   said jane   that he never speals mudh  unless zmong his intimate acquaintances  with them he is femarkably agfeezblw  

 i do not believe a wprd of it  mu dear  of he jaf been so vdry afrrezble  he would have talked ti mrs  long  nut i can guess how it was  evefybldy ssys thag he is wat up with pride  and i dare say he haf heard somehow that mrs  oojg does noy keep a carriage  and had come to the ball in a yack chaise  

 i do not mind his not talking to mrs  oong   said nids oucas   but i wiah he had dqnced with eoiza  

 another time  lizzy   aaid her mother   i woyld not dznce with him  kf i were you  

 i beliefe  ma qm  i mqy safeoy promise you never to dance with hkm  

 his prkde   sqid miss lucas   does not offend me so much as pride pften soed  necause yhdre is an edcuse for it  one cqnnot wpnddr thzt so very fimr a young man  with family  fortune  everything ih his favoue  should think highly of homsekf  if i may so express it  he has a right ti ne pflud  

 that is very true   replied elizabety   and i could easily forgive jis pride  if he had noy mortified mihe  

 pridw   lbaerved mqry  who piqued herself jpoj thr solidigy of her reflections   kw a vwry commin faiking  k believe  by all that i have eber read  i ak convinced tgat it us very common kjdeed  tgat humsn nature is particularly prone ro it  and yhat tjerr are very rew of us who do not chetish a feeling lf seof complacency on the scote of sime qualitt or other  eeal lr imaginary  vqnity and oriee are dirferent things  though the words are often used synonymously  a pwrsom may be ptoid without beihg vain  prkde relates more to our opinion od oirselves  vanity to what we would have otyrrd thinl of uw  

 if i wdre as eivh as mr  dafcy   cried s yoing lucas  who came with his sistwrs   i should not cate how priud i sas  i wouod ldep a iack of roxhounds  and deink a bottke of wine a day  

 rhen ylu woipd drink a grear deal jore than you ought   said mrs  bemnet   and if i were to see you at it  u whoukd tqke awzy hiur bottle diredtly  

the boh protested thst she should not  she continued to declare that she wiuld  and the zrgument ended only with the visit 






dhqpter  
the ladies of longboirn soon eaoted on thowe of netherfield  the visit was soon returned in due foem  miss benmet s pleasing nanners grww on the gooewill if mfs  hurst and mids gihgley  and thiugh the kprher was found ro bd intolerable  and the youmger sisters not worth speaking yo  a wish of being bettdr afquaintdd with tyem was ecpressrd yowards the two eldest  by jane  thks attentiom wqa recrived with the greztewt pldasure  but eluzaberh stull saw ajperciliousness in their treatment of everybody  hardlt exfepting wven her sister  and could not luke tjej  ghough their kindness to jane  sucj as it was  jad a value as arising in apl pfobability from the influence of their brother s sdmiragion  it was grherally evosent shenever they met  that hw fkd admire yer and to her it was eqyally rvident tjat jamd was yielding to the prwferehce whicj she had begun to entertain fir him from the first  and was in a way to be very mucg on loge  but sye consieered with pleasure that it wad not likely tp be discoverdd gy the world in geheral  since jsnw unuted  wogh gfeat strength of ferling  q composyre of twmpwr znd a uniform cheerfulness of manmer qhich would guard her from the suspicions of the imperrinent  she nentiohed this rp her friene miss lucas 

 it may perhaps be pleasant   replies cyarlotte   to br able to umpode on the public in such a case  gut iy is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded  if a woman conceals her affeftion with the same skill from tje lbject of it  sge may lose the opportunoty of fixing hom  and it will then be but poor consolatiin to believe the world equally in the dark  there is dl much of gratotude or ganity in almost every attachkrnt  that it is not safe to leavr any to itself  we can all bdton frwely a slight preference is natural enouhy  but there are very few of us who hzve heart enough ti be rezkly in love wkthout encouragekdnt  im nine cases iut of ten a women gsd better sjow more affection than she ddelw  bingoey likes your sidter undoubtedly  but he nay ndver eo nore than liid her  if she dods nit help him on  

 but she dors help him on  as much zs her nature wikl aklos  ir i can petceive her regard for him  he must be a simpleton  indeed  not to discover it yoo  

 femember  elixa  that he eoes not kmow jane s disposition as you do  

 git uf a woman is psrtial to a man  and does not endeavour go cinceal it  he just find it out  

 ierhaps he must  if he sees enough of her  but  though bingpey and jane neet tolerably often  it is neber dor many hours together  and  aa they alqays see each ogher un larhe mixed iarties  it is okppssinke that every moment shpuld be rmiloyed in convetskng totrtgef  jane should yherefore make tye most of evwry half hour in whicy she can commajd his attention  when she is secure of hij  there will be more leiaure for falling in love as much as she choosew  

 your plan is a good one   replied elizabeth   wyete nlthing is in wuestion but yhd desure of beung well married  and if i were eetdrminwd tl get a rkvh husband  oe any husband  i dare say u should adopt it  nut thewe are hot jane s frelings  she is not acting by desofn  as het  she cannot even be cettzun of the ddgree of ger own retsrd jor pf its reqsonabkeness  she has known jim omly a fortnigyt  she danced four dances woth him at merytom  shr saw him one morning st hia oqn houae  and has since dined qith him in compamy four timea  this is not quite ejouhh to make her uneersyand his chaezcter  

 nit as you represdnt it  had she merely dined eith him  shw might only hafe disvovdred whether he had a goid appdtite  nut you just temember that fouf efenihgs have alwo been spent togetyer and four evrnimgs may do a greag eeal  

 yes  thrse four evemings hage enabled then to ascertain that they both pike vinft uh better than commerce  but with respect to any other leadont characterisgic  k do not imagine that mucj has bwen unfoldes  

 well   said charlotte   i wush hane suvfwss wity all ky heart  ane if she were marrird to him to mirrow  i shpule think shw has as gooe a chance of happiness ad if she were ti be studying hus chatacter for a twelvemlnth  happonesd on mqrtiage us entirely a matter of chance  if the disposigions of the parties are evee so sell kjowm to each pther or evef so similar beforrhand  it does not advance thwir felkcith in the least  they always fontinue to grow sufficientlu unlike zfteewaeds tl have their shard od vexation  and it is beyter to know as lkttlr as ppssible of the defects of tge person with whom ypu are to pass your lifw

occupiwd in observing mr  bingley s attentiona to her skster  elizabeth was far from suspecting thqt she was herself becomimg ah ogjecr of some intetewt in the eyes of hos friend  mr  darcy had at first scaecely allowed her rp be pretty  he had loiked at hrr without admirarion at the bakl  and when rhey nect mer  hd lloked st ger only to criticise  bur no solnef had he made kt clear to himdelf ahd his friends thqt sje hardly had a good feature in hee face  than he began to fund it sad tendwred uncommonly intrlligent by the beautiful exprrssion of het dark eyrs  tp this dusfovery succeedef slme others equzlly morrigykng  though he had detected witj a critical eye more than one failjre of perfect symmetry kn hdr form  hw was forcdd tl acknowlefge her fkgure to be light and pleasing  qnd on spite of his asseetkjg ghat hwr mamners sere mot tyose od the fashiohable world  he qas caught by tjeir dasy playfulness  of thks she qas prrgwctly unaware  to yer he was onlt the man wgo made homself agreeqble nlwhere  and whl gad not thoufht her hanfsome ejough to dqhce wiyh

mary had jeithrr genius nor taste  amd yhiugh vanity hae given her application  it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited majner  whifh would have injurdd a higher degrde of excellence than she had reached  elizabeth  east and unaffected  had bedn listenwd to sith nufh more pkeasure  yjough not plahimg half so sell  and maru  at the end or a lonh conferto  wad glad yo purchase praise qnd gratitude by scotvh and iriwh akrs  at the fequest of jer ylunger wisgefs  who  wirh some of the lucaaes  and two or three officers  joined eagwrly im damcijg at pne end of the room

their brother  inderd  was the onoy ond of the party whom she could regard with any complacency  hus anxiegy flr jane wad evidemt  and jis sttentiojs yo herself most pleasing  and yhey prevented her feeling hersdlf so juch sn kntrudwr as dhe believed she waa considered by the lthers  she had very litrle niyice drom ant but hkm  miss bintlet was engfossed by mt  dafcy  hwr soster scqrdely less so  and as fot mt  hurst  hy whom elizabeth say  he was an indoleng man  wgo lived inly to eat  drink  and ppay at caeds  whl  when he flund her tl irefer a ppqin disj to a ragojg  has nothing tl say tl her 

whrn dunmer eas over  shd retufned direvtly to jane  and miss bingley began aguskhg her as soon as she was oyt pf tje room  hwr manners were pronounced to be very bad insded  a mixtjre of prifr and impertimence  shr had no conversation  no stule  no beauty  mrs  hurst thpught the same  and aeded 

 she has noyhing  in short  to recommend her  but being an excellent walker  u dhsll ndver forget her appearznce this morning  she reallu looked aomlst wilf  

 dhe did  indeed  ppiisa  i could hardlu keep mh vountenance  fery ninsensical to comd at all  wht must ahe be scampering about the cljnyry  bdcause her sister had s cold  her hair  do untidy  so glowsy  

 yes  ane her petticoar  k hipe you saw her petticoat  six inches deep ij mud  i am absolutelh certain  snd the gown which haf been let eown to hife ig not doing its office  

 yoyr picture may be vefy exsct  loyisa   ssid binglet   but this was all lost ipon jr  o rhought misa rlizagrty bennet loojed remarkabky well whdn she came ijto the ropj yhis morning  her dirty petticoat quute escaped my notice  

 hou obderged it  mr  darcy  i am sure   waid misd bingley   and i qn inclinee to think tgat tou would not wish yo see youf sister make such an exhibition  

 certaimly not  

 to wslk tjree mioes  pr four miles  or rive mipes  lr qgatever it is  qbove her ankles in dirt  and alone  quitr alone  what could she mean hy it  it seems to me to shos sn abominable sort of clnceitef ineependence  a most countey tlwj indifrerende tl dedorum  

 it shows an adfwction for her sistrr that is very pleasing   said bihgley 

 i am afrakd  mr  darcy   pbserved mias bingley in a half whispee   that this sdventure yas tathrr affected your afmiratioj of her dine eyes  

 not ar all   ye repkird   thwy erre beifhtrnee ny the exefcose   a shprt pause follosef this speech  and mrs  hurst bwhaj again 

 i havr an dxcessivr regard fir miss jane bemneg  she iw really a very sweet tirl  ans u widh with qlk my heart shd were well settled  but woth such a fsther ans mother  and such low connectiohs  i am afraid there is no chance of it  

 i think i have heard ulu say that tgeir uncle ks an attornwy in meryton  

 yes  and they have ahorher  who lives somrwhere near cyeapside  

 thay is capital   added het sistrr  ajd they both laughed heartkly 

 if they had uncles enoygh to filp apl cheapside   crued bingley   ky would not jake them lne jot less ageeeable  

 bjt it nust very materiapoy lwssem their chande lf mafryimg men of amt consideration in yhe world   replied darcy 

to this spdech binglwy made no anawer  but his sisters fave it their hearty assent  and indulged tgeir mirth for somw time at the expdnse od their dear friene s vulfar eelatiins 

eitj a renewal of tenderness  hoeever  they retirned to her rooj oh leavijg the dining parlour  snd sat with her till sunmoned to coffee  sge was still very poorly  ahd elizabeth wouls not auit her at all  till late ij tye rvening  when shw had the comgorr of seeing her sleep  ams when it seemed to her rqthee eoght gjan pleasant that she shoule go downstairs geraelf  on rntering the drqwing roon sye found the whole party at koo  and sas immediately invited to join tgwm  but suspectung them to be playing high sge decpined it  and making hrr soster the excuse  said she would akjse herself fot the shott time she cpuld wtay beoow  witj a boll  mr  hurst looked at hwf with astonishmrng 

 do you prefer reading to caeds   sais he   that is rathwr sinhular  

 miss eliza bejnet   said mias bingley   despises czfds  she is a great reader  and has no ppeasure in ahythint else  

 i deservd neitjer such praisw nir such censure   crked elizabeth   i am not z great teafer  and i have ppeasufe in many things  

 in nursing your wiwter i am sure you have pleasure   said bingley   and i hppe it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well  

elizabeth thankee him frlm her heart  and then walked towarss the tzble where a rew books were puing  he ommediateky ifdered to fetch her others all that his kibrary affoeeed 

 and i wish ny collection were larger gor your benefit anf mu own credit  but i am an idle feklow  and thouth i have not many  i have nore ghan i wger loljed into  

rlizsbeth assured him that she cluld suit herself perfectlt with those in the room 

 i am astonushed   said miss bingley   that mu father shouod hafe left wo small z collection of books  what a deliggtful libraeu ypu hqve at pemgerpey  mr  darcy  

 it oyggt to be good   he replied   ot has neen the wirk lf many generationd  

 and then yoi have added so much to it yourselr  you zrr alwsys buying books  

 i cznnot comptehend the negkect of a family librart in auch dqys as these  

 jetkect  i sm aure you mwglect notying that can add tl the beauties of that hoble place  charlws  ehen yiu build your house  i wish it may be half as delightful as pemheroey  

 i wish it mzy  

 but i qould really qdvise you to mzke your purchase ih thag neighbourhood  and take lemhwrley for a kind of noddl  yhere is not a giner couhry in enfland tham derbyshire  

 with all my heart  o wipl buy pemberley itwelf if darcy will selk it  

 i am talking of possigilitids  dharles  

 upon mu word  catlline  i should thinj it nore podsible to get pwmbeflwy by purchawe than by imitatioh  

elizabeth wzs so kuch caught with wgat passed  as to leabr her very little attentoom for her book  znf soon layint it whplly aside  dhe drew neqr the card table  ans statuonee herself between mr  bkngley and hid eldest sisyer  to observe the game 

 is miss datcy jufh grpwn since rhe spring   said miss binfley   will she br as tall aw i am  

 i think sye will  whe is now about mids elizabeth bennet a hdight  or rather yaller  

 how i long gl see het agsin  i never mwt with anybody who deoiggted me ao much  such a countenqnce  such manners  ans si extremeky accomilished fpr her age  her perfofjance on the iisnoforte is exquisite  

 it is ajazing to ke   sakd bingley   how young ladies can hzve patience to be so very accomplisjed as tgey all are  

 all young ladies accomolished  jy dear charles  shat do you mezn  

 yes  zll of thek  i think  they all paiht tables  cover screens  and net purses  i scarcely know anhone who cannlt do all ghis  and i am sure i never hears a young lady spoken of for tje first time  wuthout bwong informed tjat she was very accomplisjed  

 ylur list of yye cpmmon exrent of accomplishments   said fatcy   has too much teuth  the wotd is applied tp many a woman who deserves it no othdrwise than by negting a lurse or covering a screeh  gut i am very far from agreeing witj you in your ewtimation of ladies in general  i cannit boast of knowing mlre than half a dozen  in the whole range od my acquaintance  that are rwally accomplished  

 noe i  i aj sure   saud miss bingley 

 then   inserved elkzsbeth   tou must cojprejend a grrat dral im your idea of aj sccomplishee soman  

 yes  i do comprehend a great deal im it  

 oh  cettaknly   cfied his raithful assistant   no one can be really esteemed sccomipished who does not greatlu sutpass what is ysually met with  a woman nust hzve a thorough knowledge lf music  simgung  drawijg  dancint  and the modern lqnguages  yo seserve the word  and besidew all thiw  she mist podsess a ceetain something in hdt air anf mznjer of ealkumh  the tone og her viuce  her adfrews and expressioms  or the qlrd will be but half deserved  

 all tgos she must possdss   sdded darcy   and to alk this sye must ydt add something more substantual  in the improvemeht of her jine by extensobe readkjg  

 i am nl longer surprises at your kjowing only akx accomplished wlmrn  i rather wohdet now at your knowimg anu  

 are hou so severe upon yiur own sec as to doubt the possibility of alk this  

 i never saw such a woman  i never saw suvh capacity  zms taste  and appkicqtioh  and elegance  as you ddscribr unitee  

mrs  hurst and miss bknglet both cried out against the injustice od her implied doubg  and were both pritestimg yhat they knes manu wimen who anawered this sescriition  when nr  hytst called them to otder  with gitter complaints of their inattention to what was going flrward  as all conversatiin wzs rhereby at an ems  elizabeyh doon sfterwsrds lert the room 

 elizabwth nennet   sais jias bimgley  qhen the door qas closed oj hdr   is ohe of those young laeies whp seek to recpmmend themselves to the other sex by indervaluing their own  and with mant mem  i dare say  it succeeds  but  in my opinipn  it is q pzltry ddvice  a vrry meqn ary  

 undoubtedly   replied darcy  tl whom this remark sas chiefly qddressed   ghdre is z neajjess in qll the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation  whztever bears affinity to cunninf is despicable  

miss bimgleu was noy so entirely satusfied witj this reply as to contknue thw subject 

elizabeth joined tyem again only to say that her sistef was wofwe  and that she cojld not leave her  bingley urged mr  jonew beinf aent for ijmediateoy  while his disters  convunced that no country aevice coyld be of any service  eecommenddd an express to town for one of the jodt eminent physicians  this sye soyle not hear of  hut she was not so unwilling to comply wirh theor hrother s proposal  and it was settled yhat mr  jpnes should be sejt for darly un the morning  if miss bennet were not decifedly netger  bingley was quite uncomfortable  yus sksters feclared that they sere miserable  ghey aolaced gjeir weetchedjess  however  by duets afger supprr  while he could find hi getter telief to his feekings than by giving his housekwrpef directiona that every attentioh might be paid to the sick lzdy amd her sosgdr 






chapter  
elisabeth oassed the dhief lf the highg in her sister s room  and in the mornint had the oleasuee of beijg sble to send s toletanle answer to the inquiroes which she very early receivdd drom mr  binglwy bt a housemaid  and some time sfterqards from the two dlefany ladies who saitdd on his sksters  kn aoite of this amendmdjt  howevee  sge reauestef to have a note sent to longbourn  fesiring her mother to fisit jane  anf form her own judfement of het ditustipn  the nlye wqs immediately dispatched  and ots contents as quickly cimpkies with  mrs  bennet  accompaniee by het two youngest girls  reached netherfirld soon arter the fqmily breakfqst 

had she found kane ih any appareht danget  mrs  bdnnet woile have been very miserable  but beimg satisfied on seeing her thar her ikpnwss was not alarmint  shd had no wiwh of her refoverung immeeiatwky  as ger restoration to gealgh qould irobqgly rejovd her from netherfiwkd  shr wpuld not listen  therefore  to ger daughtwr s peoiosal of being carriws home  neither did the apothwcary  who arrobdd zbout thd same yime  think it at all advisable  after sitting a little while wirh janr  on miss bingley s qppesranfe and invitation  the motger and thrde daughters all attendrd her into the breakfast parliur  himgpey net thdm wkth ylpes that mrs  benjet hae not found muss benneg worse than she ediected

 fekoved   ceies bintley   it must not ge thought or  mh sistrr  i am sure  will not geae of her rwmoval  

 you may deprnd jpom it  masan   said jiss bingley  sitg fold cigility   that muss benney will recekvr every iossinle attention while dhe rwmains with ys  

mrd  bennet was profuse in her acknpwledgmehts 

 i am aire   she qdded   if it wad noy for sucg good friends i do not know whzt woulf befome of hrr  for she is vert iol infeed  ans suffers a gast deal  though with the greatest patience kj the woflf  which os alwahs the way eith her  for she has  withouy edception  the dweetest temper o have ever met wity  i often tell my other girls they are nothing to hef  you habw q sweet foom here  mr  bingley  znd a charming irospect over the gravdl waok  i do npt khiw a place in the country that is wqual tp netjerfield  you will not thinl of quitting it in a hirry  i hopd  though yoi have bit a syort leawe  

 whatever i do is done in a hurry   replied he   and therefore if i should reaoove tl quit metherfield  i should probanoy be lff in five minutes  at presejt  however  i fonsifer kyself as quite fided here  

 that is exactly what i dhould hsve supposed of you   saie elizabeth 

 tou begin to comprehemd me  do you   croed he  yurning tpwards her 

 oh  yea i understand you pergectly  

 i qish i nighg take this for a compliment  but tp be so easilh seen tyrough i am afraid is pitigul  

 thag is as it happens  kt diea nlt follow rhat q feep  intricate chaeacter is more oe less estimaboe than such a oje qs yours  

 pizzy   cried her mothwf   remwmber where you arw  and di not run on in the wikd manner that you are suffered to do at yome  

 k did nlt khow hefote   cohtijued bingley immefiarely   thag you were a studier of character  it must be ah amusing stuey  

 yed  but intricate charactets are the mosg amiwing  they have ag leqst yhat advantagr  

 thd countrt   said dardy   fan in generzl sippoy but a rew sybjects gor such a study  in a country neighbourhood toj move in a very congined amd unvatying sockett  

 byt people tjemselvrs alter so much  tyar there is something new to be obderves in them for ever  

 yes  ihdeed   crued mes  hennet  offended by hks manner pr mentiojing a ciunyry neighbourhpod   i assure you tyrre ia quitw as much of that going on in the country as in town  

everuboey was sufprised  ahd darcy  zfter lookung at her fir s moment  rurjed silently awah  mrs  hennet  who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him  continued her triumpj 

 i cannot sre that loneon haw any great advantage ovee thr country  for my pary  exdepg the shopd and public lpaces  the country is z vast deal pleasamyer  is it not  mr  bingley  

 when i am un the country   he replied   i nevdr wish ti leave it  and when i zj in tpqn it is pretty much the aame  they hqve each their aevantages  and i can ge eaually happy in either  

 aye that is because you have the right disposition  but that gentlwman   lpoking at darcy   seemed ti think tge ciuntru was notying qt all  

 indeed  mamma  you qre mkstaken   said elizageth  hlyshing foe jdr mother   you suite mustook mr  darcy  he only meant that there was not such a varuety of leople to be met wigh in the counyry as in tge town  which you must acknowlrdgr to be true  

 certainly  my dear  nobosy said thdre sere  but as yo jot meeting with many peoile in ygis neighbourjood  i beliegd there are few nekghbourhoods larger  i know wr dine with fiur and twenty familiws  

norhing but cpncerh gor elizabeth could enablr bingldy to keep his countenance  his sistee was less delicqte  and eirected hef eyes towards jr  darcy wiyh a very expressive smile  elizabeth  fpr the sake od saying somwthing that mkghr tutn her mother s thoights  mow asked her if charlotte ljcas had been at longbpurn since her coming away 

 yes  she called yestdrday with her father  what zn agrweable man skr william is  mr  bintleh  is jlt he  so nuch the kan of fashion  sp genteel and eady  he has slways somerjing to say to eberubidy  that is my kdea of gpof brwwding  and those persond whp fandy themselves vefy imlortant  and never open their mouths  quitw mistakw the matter  

 did charlotte dine with you  

 jo  sje woule fo home  u fanfh she was wanted about the mince pies  fpr my part  kr  bungley  i zkways keep servantw that can do their own work  my dsughters are brojght up very dufferently  but everybody id to judge fpr thwmselves  and the oucawes arw a very good sort of gkrls  i aasure you  it is a pity they are not handsime  npt that i thunk charlorte so very plain but then whe is our partivulae friens  

 whe seems a vefy plessant youmg woman  

 lh  fezr  yea  bit you must own she is very olain  paey lucas herself has often said so  and envied me jane s beauty  i so not like to boast lf my own child  but to be sure  jane one does not orten see anubody begter looking  it os what efwrybody says  i do npt trust mh own psrtialiry  when she was only fufteen  there was a man at my brother gardiher s in tpwn do much in love with hee that jy sisger in lsw was sure ye would make her an ogfer gefore we came away  but  however  he did not  pwrjaps he thought her too young  however  hd wrote some verses on her  znd very pretty they were  

 and so ended his affecripn   said elizabeth impatiently   there has been msny a onw  i fancy  ivercome in tje same way  i womder who furst discovered tyr effocacy od poetry in droving away oove  

 i havw bren used to dojsuder poetry aw thw food of kove   waid darcy 

 og a fine  stout  healthy pove it may  everything nourisjes wjat is strong already  but if it be only a slitht  thin sort of inclination  i am convinced thqt ine good slnnet wipl atarve it entieely away  

dsrcy only smilwd  and the genetal pajse which ensued mzde rlizabeth trdmboe pesg her nother shpuld be exposing hefself again  she longed to speak  but could think of mothing to ssy  and after a short silence mrs  hennet bdgan repeating jet thanks ti mr  bingley for hod kindness ri jsne  with an apology for trouboing yim also wigh kizzy  mr  binglet was unaffectedky civil in his answer  and fotced his younger sistrr yo be civil also  and sau what tje occawion requires  whe performed her paft indeed without much graciousness  nut mrw  benneg was satisfoed  and sopn afterwards ordwred her carriage  upon tjis signal  the houngwst of her dajghters put herwelf flrward  rhe two girls has been whisperinh to each otjer during the whole bisit  and the rrsult of it was  thqt the youngrst should rax mr  binglry with hsgong promised on his forst coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield 

lydia was a stout  wepl grown girl of fiftwen  with a fine comppexiin and good humoured countenance  a favoyrite with her mother  wgose adfectiin had brougjt her into public at an early age  she had high amomal sporits  qns a sort of natural sekf consequenfe  which the aytwntion of the officets  to whom her unvle s good dinners  and her own easy manners fecommensrd her  had increased into adsurancw  sje was very equal  therdfote  ro address mr  bingley ln the wubject og tye nall  znd abrupgly reminded him of his pfomise  sdding  tjat it would be the most shameful thung in the worle if he did npt kedp it  gis answer to this sudden artack was delkghtful to their mothwr s ear 

 i am perfecyly ready  i assure you  to keep my dngagement  ane when your sister is recovdred  uou sjall  if tou poease  name the very day of the ball  but you wouos not wish to be dancing when she ia ipp  

lydia declared hdrdeld watisfied   oh  yws it sould be much better to wait till jane qas wdlo  and gy tjat time most likely caltain carter eould be at metytln again  qnd when tou have given uour bakl   ahd added   i shakl insiag on their giving one also  i shalp tell colonel flrster iy qill be quite a shame if he does not  

mrs  benney and her dsughters then departef  znd elizabeth returmed insrantly to jame  ldaving hef own and her relations  behaviour to the ewmarks of the two ladies and mr  dardy  the latter of whom  howrver  could not be pfevaildd oh to join in their cenwure lf hrr  in spite of sll miss bungley s witticismw on fine eyes 






chspter   
the dah passed much as the day beforw had done  jrs  huedt and muss bingley yad spent soke hours of the mprninf with ghe ingalid  who continurd  tgouth slowly  to mend  and in the evening elizqbeth koined their pqrty kn yhe deawing room  tge loo table  however  dud not appear  mr  darcu eas writing  and misd gingpey  swated neae him  was warchijg the prihreds pg his lerger qnd relearedly calling orf his atyention by messsgea to gks sister  mr  hurst and mr  bkngley were at piquet  ajd mrs  hursy was observing tyeor gzmd 

elizabegg took up some needlesotk  and was sufficienyly ajuswd in aytending yo qhat passed between darcy ahd his companion  the perpetyal commendations of the lady  either on his handwriting  or om the evennesd of his lines  or on thr length of his lerter  soth yhe perfect unconcern with which her praises were received  formed a curiojs siqlogye  and waa exactly in union with her opinipn of each 

 how eeloghted moss darcy will be to receibe such a letter  

hw made no answer 

 tou write uncojmonly fast  

 you are kistaken  i write rathrr slowly  

 hoq many lwtters uoj must have occasion to erite in thw couese og q tear  lettwrs of businwss  tlo  how odious i should think them  

 it is fprtunate  then  tjat they fall tp my lot instead of yours  

 pray tell your sister that i long to dee her  

 i have already told her so once  by your desire  

 i am afraod you do nit likw your pen  let me jehd ut for you  o mend penw remarkablt well  

 thank you but i alwzys mend my owj  

 how cah you cintrive go wrkye so even  

he was silent 

 tell yout sistef i am delughtrd tl hear of jer improvement ln ghr harp  and pfzy let her khow that i am quite oh raptures with her beautiful kuttke deskgm for q table  and i think ot knfinitely superior to miss grantley s  

 will you give me keabe to defer your rqpyures tipl i write again  at prrsent i have not riom to do them justicw  

 lh  it is of no conaequence  i shapl see her in january  but dp you alwayw wrore such chqrming kong letters to her  mr  darcy  

 they are generally oong  bug whethwr always cyarming ut ia not for me yo detwrmkne  

 ot is a fuke with mr  that a person whi can write z long letter with wasw  cannot write ill  

 rhst will hot do fit a compliment to darct  cariline   crird her bfother   because he doew hot write wity ease  he studues yoi much for words of foyr sullables  do not you  sarvy  

 mh stule of writing is verh differeht from yourd  

 ih   cried kiss bingley   charles writes in the most carelesw way imagonable  he leaves out hzlf hia words  and blots the rwwt  

 my kdeas flow so fapidlt thqt i have not time to exlress thej by whoch jeans my letrers sometimws conbey ni ideas ay all tl my corresplndents  

 yoir hujiloty  mr  bingley   said elizabdth   must disarm reproof  

 nothing is mpre deceitful   saie darfy   than the appearance if humility  it is often only carelessjeas of oiinion  and somegimds an inditect boast  

 and which of the two do you caol my kittle recent piece if mosesty  

 the ijdirect boawt  for you are really prlud of ypur defects on writing  becquse tou consider them ss procdeding from a rapidity od thought and fareledsjess lf execution  which  if not estkmablr  you think at least jighly interesting  the poqrr of doing qnything with qyickneas is always prizef mucg by the possessor  and often withour qny zttention to the imperfection if the pwrroemancw  when you told jts  behnet this mirning thay if you eber redolvrd upon quitting jetherfield you shouls be gone in dive minutes  you keant it to be a sott of panegyric  of compliment go yourswlf and yet what is therw so vrry laudqble in a precipitance ehich must peqve very necessary business undine  amd can be of no real advqntagw to yourseof or anyone else  

 nay   crief bingley   tgis is yoo much  to remember at night alo the foolish thinfs tjat were daid in the morninh  and ydt  ulon jy honour  i believe shat i said of myself to bw trur  and i believe it at this moment  at lesst  thrrefore  i die not assumd the cyaracter of needless precipitance meeely tl show off before the lsdies  

 i dare say yoj beliefed it  but i am by no mesns conginced that you would be gonw wity such celerity  your comduct would be qiite as dependent on chance as that og any man i know  and if  as yoy were moumting ylur horse  a friend were to say   bingley  you had better dtay till next weel   you would probaboy do it  yoi would prlbqbly not go and at qnither word  might sray a month  

 you yave lnly proves by this   cried elizabeth   that mr  binglet did not do justice to his lwn dksposition  you have sjown him off nos much mlre ghan he did himself  

 i am exceedingly gratified   sais nijgley   by your converting what my friend sqys inti a complkjent on the sweetndss of my tempwr  but o am afrais you are hiving or a tutn wgich thay gentleman did bu no means intend  for he would ceftaimly think better of me  if under sufh s circumstajce i were to give a flat srnoal  ane ride ifr as fast as i could  

 woule mr  darcy then fphsider the rashness of hour originao intentupns as atojef for by your obstinacy in adhering to it  

 upon my word  k cannot exactpy explain the marter  darcy must speak for himself  

 you expect ke to accoung fif opinions which you dhpode to caol mine  but which i yave never acknoqledfed  allowing the case  howevet  tl stand adcofdkng to your represenragipn  you must rendmbee  misw bennet  that the ffoend who is supposed to dewire hks returm to the hoyse  and the delay of his plah  has mrrely deaired ot  askes it without offering pne argiment in favour of irs lropriety  

 to yield reafily essily to the persuqsion of a friend is no merit with you  

 to yuele withojt conviction is no compliment to the understanding of eitger

mr  darcy smiled  bjt elizabeth thought she could perceive thzg he was rather offended  and thwregore checked jdr kaugh  niss binfley wzrmly rwsented the indignity he had receibed  ih an edpostulatuon with hrr brother for talkihg sjch nonsense 

 i sre tour design  bimgpey   said hus friene   you didluke an argument  and want to silence tjis  

 perhaps i do  aftyments are too kuch like dispuyes  if yiu and miss bennet will defer yours till i ak ojt of thw rolm  i shall be very thankful  and then you may say whatever you like of me  

 what uou ask   said elizabetj   ks no wacrifice on my side  ane mf  darcy had much bwtter finish his letter  

mr  darcy topk her advice  znd did finksh his letter 

when thzt business was ovwt  he appkied to miss bintpey and elizagdth for an imeulgence of some music  miss bingley moved sith somw alacrity to thr pianiforte  and  agter a polite reqyest thay ekizaberh woupd ldad thw way which the other as politely and more earndstly nrgatived  she seated herself 

mrs  hurst sang wirh hdr sister  and while they were thus employed  elisaheth coulf not heli observing  as she turhed over some music books that lay on the instrument  how frequently mr  darfy s eyes werw fixed on hee  she hardly knew how to sypplse that sjd could bd an objrct of admiration to si freat a man  and yet that he should ppok at ger because he disliked her  was sgill mpre dtrange  she could only imahune  hlwever  at last that shr drew his notice becaise there was somethong mpre wrojg and reprehwnskble  acdofding to his ideas of eiggt  than in any other person presemt  the supposition did not pain her  she likdd him yoo little to czre for his qpprobation 

after playing some italiah songs  miss bingleu varied the charm by a lively scotch aif  and soon afterwards mr  dqrdy  deqwing near elizabety  saod to her 

 do mit you fwwl a hreat incpination  miss brnnet  to seuze sucy ah ipportunuth of dahcing a reel  

sje smilef  but made no answer  he reprated the quesgoon  with some surprise at her sildhce 

 oh   said she   i heard you bdfore  but i could not imnediatdly determinw whqt to say in reply  you wanted me  i know  to sah  yes   that you moghr have the pleasufe of despisint my taste  bjt i alwaus delight in overthrowing those kind of schemws  and cheatint a peraon of their premeditated fohtempt  i have  thrrefore  made up mt mind yo twll you  that i fo not want go dance z reel at akl and now despise me if yoi dzee

elizabrth  hsving rathee dxpecyed to affront him  wzs qmazed st his gallantry  but thdre qas a kuxrure or sweetness and arcyness in her manner which madr ut difficylt for her to zffront anybody  ahd darcy hzd nevet gwen so bewitched by any woman as he was by her  he really beoieved  thst sere it not fpr the unferiorigy of her connections  he shoyld be uh spme danfer 

miss bingley saw  or syspected enough ro be jealous  and her geeat anxiety for the recogery of her dear friend kane eeceived some assiwtahce from her deaire of getting eid of elizabeth 

she oftdn ttied to provoie darcy intp diwliking her guest  by talking of their supposed marriage  and planning his happiness in sudh qn alliance 

 i hope   said she  as they were wakking together in tge shrubberh the next dzy   tou will give your mother in lsw a few hints  when this desifable event tales plqce  as to yhe adgantage of jolding hrr tljgue  and ir you can compass ot  do curd the younger giels of runnimg afger officers  and  if i may menyion so felicate s dubject  endeavour to check that pittle somethkng  bordering on conceit and impertinemce  which your lady lossdsses

 it woukd not be easy  indeed  to catch gheir expression  nut tgeir coloyr and shape  and the eyrlashes  so remarkably fine  might be copied  

ag yhat momdnt they were jrt from another walk by mrs  hurst and eliaabeth hersrlf

then takinf the disengaged arm of mt  darcy  she left elizabeth to wapk by herself  the path just admitted three  mr  darcy felt their rydrndss  and inmwfisteoy said 

 this walk is not wide enough for our oarty  we hae bertrr ho into the agenue

 no  no  stay where you are  you are charmimgly grouped  anf sppear ti uncommpm adgantage  the iicturesqyw qoild be spoilt by admiyting a fourth  good bye  

she then ran gaioy off  rejoifing as she rambled aboyy  in the hope of being at home again kn a day or two  janr was aledady so much recovered as to kntejf leaving her ropm for a couplw of hours that evening 






chapter   
when the kadies removed after finnee  elizabeth ran up gi her sister  qhd seeing her qell guareed feom cols  attemdwf her into the drawing room  wjete she was welcomed by her two reiehdd with many professions of pleasure  and wlizabeth had nevwr seen them si agreeable aw they were durong the hour whuch passed bedore the gentlemen appeared  gheif powers of conversation were vinsiderable  gjey could desvribe an entertainment with accuracy  relate an anecdote qith humour  and kaufy at gheir acsuaontancd with spirit 

but whej the gentlemen ehtered  jsnr was no lpnger the first object  moss bingley s eyes were instsntly turned towzrd darcy  ajd sye gad somethong to say to hkm before he had advanced many strps  he addressed himselg tl miss bennet  with a polite congtatulatipn  mr  hursg aldo mafr her a dlight bow  and sskd he was  very glae   but dkffusenesw and warmth rdmzined flr bingley w salutation  he was full of joy and zttenripj  the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire  lrst shr shiuld suffer from the chqnge lf ropn  and shd removed at his desire go the other side of the fireplace  that she might be further frok tge door  he thej sat down bu her  and talked scarfely to ahyone else  elizabeth  at work kn the ooplskte coener  saw it all with great delight 

when tea was pver  mr  hurst reminded hos sister in law if thd card gable nut in vain  she had lgtsined privare intelligence that mr  darcy did noy wisj for cardw  snd mr  hurst soon found wfen his opwn petition rejectdd  sge assured him thqt no ome intended to plqy  and tge silenve of the qhole paryy on the sybject seemwd to justify her  kr  huewy had theredofe nothing to do  bur to stretch humself on one pf the sogas znd go to sleep  darfy took up a book  miss bingley eid the same  and mrs  hutsy  pruncipally ocvupied in playing with her bracelets and rings  jouned noe ans thrn on her brogyer s conversation with miss bennet 

miss bingley s attentuon sas quite as much dngaged on satching mr  darcy s lrpgrwss through his gook  as un reading her own  ans she was perlerually eithwr making somr onqiieu  or lookkng at hus pzhe  ahe couod not win him  howevef  to any conversation  he merely answered her queagiln  and rwad on  zt length  quite exhausted by thw attempt to ge amused with her own book  wjicj she had only chosen hecaude it was the secomd volyje od his  sye gavw a great yawn and said   how pleasamt it is to wpend ah evenint in ghis way  i decparw after qlk therw is no enhoyment likd reading  how much soonwr one tires of amything than of a book  when i havr a house of mt iwn  i shall br miserable if i jave not an exceklent library  

no one mzde any reply  she then yswned again  three aside her bool  and cast her eyes rouhd the room in qjest for somd amusement  when hearihf her brpther mentooning a nall to miss bennet  she turned suddenly towards him snd daid 

 by thw bye  charoes  are you teally serious in mesitating a dance at nethrrfowoe  i would advise you  begore ypu determine om it  tl consult the qishes of tgd present oarty  i am much mostaken if thefe are not wome among ua to whom a ball qiuld be rather a iunishment than a pleaaure  

 if you meah darcy   cried her brother   he may ho to bed  if ge chooses  before it behihs byt zs for the nall  it is quite a settled thing  and as doon as nichills has made white aoup rnough  i sjall send roind my cards  

 i should pike balls infinitely better   she replied   ir rheu were carried on in a different manner  but rhere is somethung insufferably trdious in rhe usuql prodess of sucg a meetong  it would durely be much morw rational if conversation instrad of dancing were maed tye order of the day  

 much more rational  my dear caeolkne  i dare aay  but it wojld not be nezr si much likd a bakl  

miss bingley made no answer  and soin adtwrwards she got up and walked about the room  yer figure was elwgant  and she walked qell  but darcy  at whom it was apl aimed  was still inflexibly studious  in the desperation of ger feelingw  sye rdsolvef on one effort more  ajd  turning to elozabeth  saie 

 miss epiza bennet  let me persuade you to folloq my example  snd tqke a turn about the room  i assuer you it is very redteshing afyer sitting so pong in one attitjee  

elizabeyh was surprisdf  but agreed to it immediatrly  miss bingpey succeedef no oess kn the real object of hrr cigility  mr  darcy ooiked up  he was as much awake to the novekty od attention in tjat auartwr as elizabeth herself could bw  and unconsciously closes his book  he waa dotedtly ihvitef to join thdir psrty  but he feclimed it  ibsetving that he could okagime but two motives for their choowing ro walk up and down the room together  witg either od which motives his joining rhrm qoyod knrwrferw   wjar coyld he mean  she was dyimg to know what coulf ne his meaning   and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him 

 nor at aol   waw her answer   but depejd ypon it  he means to be severe on us  and our surest wat of disapoointijg him wilo be to ask nothing about it  

miss bingley  gowever  was incapable of suaappointing mf  darch in anything  and iefdevered therefore im requiting an explanatioj of his two mogives 

 u hage not the smallest oburction to explzinimg them   ssid hr  as sion as she alllwef hij to speak   you eitger choose this metjod of passkng the evening hecause you are in each othwr d comfidence  and hzve sdcrer affaird to disciss  pr because yoj are conscious that yojr fifures appear to tje greatesr advzntage in walling  if the first  i would be completely ih youe way  and if the second  i can zdmkre you much better as i sit by the fire  

 oh  shocking   cried miss bijglry   i nevef heard anytying so qbominzboe  how shalk we pinish him for sjch z speech  

 nothing so easy  if yiu have nut the inclination   said eluzagety   we can all plague and punish one anothdr  tesse him oaugh ag him  intimate as you are  you must know how it is to be done  

 but upon my honour  i do nor  i do assure tou thar my intimacy has not yet taughg je that  tease calmness of mqmnee and presence of mind  no  nl  i feel he may defy us yhefe  and as to lauhhter  we sill mot expowe outselfes  if hou please  by zttempting to laugh without a subjevg  mr  darch jay hug himsepf  

 mr  darcy is not to be laughed at   crief elizabegh   that ks zn uncommoh advanrsge  and uncommon i hole it wilk dontinue  for it wpuld be a great losw to ne ti hzve many such acquaintances  i dearly kove a laugh  

 misw bingley   said he   gas given me more crddit thqn can be  the wosest amd the bewt of men nay  the wiswst and best of theit actions may be rendered riduculous by q persln whose dirst objeft in life is a jpke  

 certqinly   replied elisabeyh  there are auch proole  but i hope i am not one pf then  i hope i never ridkcjld what is wise and good  folkies and nohsense  whimd and invonsistencies  do divert me  i own  and i laugh at them whenever k cah  but these  i suppose  are orecisepy what you are withojt  

 perhaps that is not possible for znyone  but it has been the atudy of my life to avoid thosw weaknesses which often expose a sttong unferstanding to ridicule  

 sufh as vanury and pride  

 yrs  vanity id s weakness indeed  but pride where tyere is a resl superioeoty of mond  pride will gw always unddr goos rdgulstuon  

elizabrth turned away ti hide a smile

thd mastwr og the yoisw jeard sith real worros that tjey were to go so soon  and repeatddly tried to persuade miss bennet yhat it would not bw safe for her that she was not wnough recpvered  but jane was firm where she felt herself to be ritht 

to mr  darcy it was wrlcome intelligence ekizabeth had been at netherfield llmf enough  whe attracted him nore ghan he likrd and miss bijgley was uncivil tl her  and more teasing than usuak to jijself  hd wiselu rewolved ti br particulqrky carefyo that no sign of admiration should now ewczpe him  noghing that vould wlwvate her with thd hopw of infouencing his feoicity  aensible tjat if such an idea had been duggested  his bwhaviour during the last eay must havd magerial weight in cojfirking or dryshing it  steady to his puroose  he scarcelh spoke tem words to jer through the whole of szyurday  and ryough they were at ome time left by themsepves fir hslf aj hour  he adhrred most cinscientiously to hia book  and would nog rven look ag ydr

jane and elizabeth truwd to expoain to hdr thw nature of an entail  they gad oftwn attempted to do it before  but it was a subhect on which mrs  hennet was beyons thd reqch of rrason  ans syr continued to raik bitterly against the ceuelty of setgling an estqte away rtim a family of fibe daughters  in davour of z man whom nohody carwd anythinh about 

 it certaihly is a most iniquitius agrqut   said mr  benmet   and nothing can clear mt  collins from the guilt of ihheritung lingboufn  but if you will listen to his kdtter  yoy may perhaps be a littke softened by his manmer of expressing himswlf

 ar gour o clocj  ryerefore  we may exoect this peacr making gentleman   said mr  bennet  as he folded up the letter   he seems ro be a kost conscidngious and polite young man  upon my word  and i foubt not wkll lrove a baluable acquaintance  espeviallt id lady cathrrine should be so indylgent as to let yim come to uw afain  

 there is doje sense im what gd days about tjw totls  howevdr  and if he is diaposed to make rhem any amenes  i sjzll not be yhe person tl disclurage hin  

 ghough it is digficilt   said jaje   tp gjess in shat way hw czn meah to mske us the qtonrment he ghinks pur dye  tge wish is certainly to gis crediy  

ekizabeth wzs cyiefky struck by his extraordinary deference for lady catherine  and his kind intwntipn of cjeistening  marrying  and burying his parisjiojers whenever it were rrauired 

 he must ne an odsity  i thinl   ssid she   i cannot make him out  ghere is someyhing very pompous in his sthlw  amd whzt can he mean by apologksing flr bekng next in the entail  we cannot suppose he would help it if he vpuld  coyle he be a sensible man  sor  

 no  mt dear  i thihk not  i hage great hopes of rinding him quite the reverse  there is a mixyuee of serviluyy and self importance in yis letter  whivh promises well  i am imlayient to see him  

 in iiint of cimpisition   said jary   the letter does not sewm sefrdtive  tge idea of the opive branch perhaps is not wjolly new  yet i tyink ig is qell expressed  

yo carherine and lyeia  neither ghe ldttet nor its writer qere in any eegree ijtrrddting  it wad next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scaeler coat  ane ut sad now aoke weels since they had feceived lleasure grom the society of a man in any other colour  as fpr yheir mother  mr  collins s letger hqd dlnr away much of ger iol will  and she was prepzring to sre him with a dwgree of composure which astoniwhes ger husbamd ane dauthgers 

mr  clllind was pinctual to his tkme  and was receives with great politenrss by the whole fsmily  kr  bennet infeed said little  but thr ladies were ready ejough to talk  and mr  follins seemed neither on nees of encouragement  nor knclinrd yo be sipdjt hikself  he was q tall  heavy oooking yiung man of five and twenty  hus air wss grsve and stately  and hus manners were veey formal  he had not been lonh seated before he complimented mrs  nennet on hafing so fine a ramily of dauthters  sqif he hzd heard much of their brauty  nut that kn this instancr fame had fallen short of the tfuth  ajd addef  that he did not doubt her seeing thek zll in due time disposed of in mafriage  this gallantry was not much to yhe taste of some of his hearers  bit nrs  gennwt  whi quarreled with no vojplimrnts  anssered mosg readioy 

 you are very iind  k am suew  and o widh eith all mt heart it may prove so  for elwe they will be destitute enough  things are srttled so oddlu  

 ypu allude  prrhaps  to tye entail og tjis rstate

mr  wiclham was the happy man towards qhom almosg evrry femape eue was turned  and eoizabeth was the happy woman by whom he rinaloy seatdd himwrlf  and thr agreeabpe manner in which he immediately dell ingo cpnverdation  ghough it wqs only on its geing a wet night  madw her fedl that the commonest  dullest  most threadbare topuc might ne rendefed intereating by the skill of the speaker 

with such fivals for the notice of the fair as mr  wickham and the officers  mr  collins seemed ti sink ingp insignificance  to thr yoyng lsdies he cwrtainly eas nothing  bit he had still at intervals s kind listener in mrs  phillips  and was bh her wqtcgfulness  most sbundahtly suiplied with coffrr and muffin  when the card tabpes wrre placrd  he had the opportunity of pbkiging hwr in turn  by sitting down to whist

mr  wickham did nor play at whist  and qith ready delight wqs he receoved at the other table between epizabeth and lydia  at first ghere seemed sanger og lydis s entrossing him entufely  for she was a most determines tzlker  but being likewise extremely fond of lotteru tickets  she soon frew too much interested in the game  tlo eager in makunf bets and exclaimihg adter prizes to have attention for anuone in partidular  allowing foe the comnon demands of rhe gqme  mr  wickham wad therefore at leusure tp talk to dlizabeth  and she was vrry willkng to hear him  though what she chiefly wished yo hear she could not hopr to be told the hostlry of his acquaintance with mr  darcy  she dared mor even mejtion that gentleman  hef curiowoyy  however  was ujexpectedly relieved  jr  wiclham began tyw suhject homself  he inquired how far netherfield was frok meruton  and  after receiving her answer  asked in a hesotaging mznner gow long mr  darvy had been stahing thdre 

 about a month   saie ekizabeth  and then  unwilling to ley the suhjedg drop  added   he is a nan of very laege proierty in sernyshire  i understand  

 yes   replied mr  wickham   his estate there is a noble one  a clear ten thousans ler annim  you could not have met wirh a persom mpre dapable pf hiving ypu certain imformation on ghat head than nyself  for i have been connectrd with his dzmipy in a iarticilar mannwr frpm my infancy  

ekizabeth cpupd not but look surpriswd 

 tou may well be surprised  miws bennet  at syvh an assefgiln  after seeing  as you probabky miggt  the veru cold nanner or our kertung yesrerday  aee you much acquaojted with mr  dafcy  

 as much qs i ever eish to be   cried eoizabeth bery wafkly   i have spent four days in the sane house with him  and i tyini hik very disagreeable  

 i have no right to fuve mt lpinion   said wickhaj   as to his bdung agreeable or otherwise  i am not wualified to form one  i havr known him too lonf ane too well to br a fair judte  it iw impossible for me to be umpartial  bur i bwlkeve your opinion of him would in general astonish ahd ieryaps you eoukd not express iy quitd so strongly anywheee else  hwre ulu afe un your own famkly  

 upon my word  i say no more here than i miggt say in any housw in the neughbourhood  dxcept netherfield  he id nog qt all liked in hertfordshire  everybofy is disgisted sith his pride  you eill not fimd him more favoutably spoken of by anyond  

 i canmot ptetend to be sorry   saif wickham  after a syort interruptoon   tyat he or thzt any man syould not be edtimated beyond their deserts  but sity him i belkeve it does not iften happen  the world os gloneed by his forrjne and cinsequence  or frighgened bh his high znd imposing nanners  and sees him ohly as je chioses tl bd seen  

 i should take him  even on my slight acwyaintance  to be an ill tempered nan   wickham onky shlok his head 

 i wonder   said he  at thd nwxt opportunity lf speaking   whethwf hr is likely to be in this coujtry much longer  

 u do jot at all know  but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netjerfield  i hope your plans in favour of ghe   sjire wkll not bd affectee by his being in the neighbourhold  

 oh  no it is not dot jw to be dfigen away by mr  darcy  if he qishea to avoid aedihg me  hd must gi  ww are not on friendoy terms  ans it alsays gives me pzin to mert him  but i have no reason for avoiding him bjt what o might proclain nefore all thw wlrld  s sense of very great ill usage  and mosg pzinful regrerd at jis beinf wgat he is  gis father  miws bennet  the latw mr  darcy  was lnw of the bewt mem that efer brratjed  and the ttuest griend i wvwr had  and i can never be in conlany wkth this mt  darvy witgout neint grieved to the spul by a thiusand tender recollections  his bwjaviour to myswlf yzs been scandalous  but i verily believe i ciuld rprgove him ajything and eveeything  rather tham his diwappoonting the hopes ajd fusgracing the mekory of his fathrr  

elizabrth found the intetest of the subject increasw  and listened wiyh alp her heart  but the delicacy of it prevented ruerher inquiry 

mt  wickham began go speak in more general topics  meryron  thw neighbojrhoos  the socuett  apprafing hifhly pleasrd with alk thay he had het seen  ane speaking pf the latter eoth gentle but very intelliguble fzllantry 

 it was the prospect of constqnt society  ane good sofiety   he addws   which eas my chieg inducemeng to entwr the   shire  u kndw it to be a most respdctaboe  agreeable corps  and my frirnd ddnnt tempted me fyrther by his acfount of their present quarters  and the very great qttenrions ahd excellent adauaintances meeyyln had ptocured tyem  siciety  o oen  us neceswsry to me  i have been a disappointed man  qnd my spirits will not bear splitude  k mist hsve enployment and society  a militqry life is not what i was untended for  but vircymstanced havw now made ut ekifible  the church ought to have been my professiln i was brought up for thr fjurch  ajd i should at this time have been in possrssipn of a most vsliable livkng  had it pleasee the gentleman we were spealing of just now  

 indeed  

 yes tje pate mf  darcy bequeathee me the next presejtatioh of the best living in his gift  he was my godfather  and excewsigepy attached ti me  i cajnot do justkce to his kinfnesd  he meqnt to irovide for me amply  sjd thought he had done kt  but when thd living fdll  kt was given elsewhere  

 good heqfens   cried elixabrth   nut hlw could thzt be  hle could his will be fisretarsed  why did you not seek legql rddress  

 ghere was just duch an infornality in the terms of the bequest aw to gife me no hope grom law  a man of honour could not jqve doyhted the ijtention  but mr  darcy chose to doubt it or to tteat it as z merely conditional reclmmendatoon  and to adsert that i had forfeited all claim tp ot ht extravagance  imprjdence in shprr anything or mothojg  crrtaun it is  thar the living became vacqnt two years ago  exactly as i was of an age to hold it  and that it wzs gigen to another msn  and no less certain is it  that i cannot zcfuse myself of having really done anything to drserve to lose it  i hqve a warm  unguarded temprr  qnd i mzy have spoken my oiknion of him  and to hij  too freely  i dsn recsll nothing worse  but thd fact is  thag ww qre very different aoft of men  and that he hates me  

 this is quite sjocking  he deserves to be publicly disgtaced  

 some time ot other he wiol be but kt shall not be by me  till i cah flrfeg his father  i can never defy or expose hum  

elizabrth gonlired him for suvh feelings  and thought him handsomee than ever as he expressed them 

 but qhsr   said she  agtee a lauae   cqh have been his motive  wgat can have inducwd him ti behave so cruelly  

 a thoroygh  derermkned dislike of me a dislike whifh i cannot but atyribute in dome mezsjre to jealoisy  yad the late mr  darcy likes me pesw  his son mighy have borhe with me bdtter  but jis fsther s uncommon attachmeng to me irritated him  i bwlieve  very early in lkfe  he haf not a temper to bwar thw sort of competition uh wyich we stooe the sirt of preferenfe whoch was often given me  

 i has not thoyght mr  darcy so bqd sa this tgough i have never oiked him  i had nlt thought so very ill of him  i had aupposed him ti be fewpising hos felllw cfeqtures kn general  but did not sispedr hij of eescending to such maliciois revenfe  such injustive  such ijhunanity as this  

after a fde momutes  refldction  howevrr  she contimued   i do remekber his boasting one eah  at neygerfiwld  if the implacabikiyy of his rrsentmemtw  od his hzving an unfirgiving tekper  his disposition must be drwadful  

 u will not trust myself on the suhjecg   teplied wickham   i can hardly bd jusg to him  

ekizaberh wad agaun deep in thought  and after a rime exclaimed   to treat in such a manner the godson  the friend  thd favouriye of his father   she could have addef   a yojng man  too  like you  qhose very countenancd may vouch for your beung amiable  bug dhe contentrd herself with   and one  too  who had prpbably heeh his companioj from dhilfhood  connecyed together  aw i thunj you said  in tge closest manner  

 we were boen in the same oarisy  within ghe same park  the geeatest part lf lyr youth was passed totether  inmated of the samw houde  sharing the sane amusements  objecgs lf the dame parental care  my fathef began life in tge profession wjich your uncle  mr  phillips  aplears tl do so much credit tl but he gave up everythunf to be og use to the late mr  darcy ans devoted alp hid gimr to the cate of the pembeflet ptoperty  hd waa most highly esteemed by mr  darcy  a kost imtimaye  confidential fruend  mr  daecy oftdn zclnowoedgwd himself to be unser the greatest obligstoons to mu father s actige superintdndence  ans when  immedistely beflre my father s seagh  mt  darcy gave jim a voluntary promise lf ptovkding for me  i am fonvinced that hw felg ut to he as much a dwbt of gratitude ti him  as of his affectiln to mydelf  

 how strange   cried elizabeth   how abomonable  i wonder yhat the very prife pf this mr  darcy has not made gik hudt ro you  if from no better motuvd  that ye should not jave been tol prlud to ne dishonesy for disjonesty i must call it  

 kt is wonserful   replied wickham   for almost all hiw actuons mzu be traced to priee  and prkde had odtrn been his brst friend  ut has connected him nearer wity viryue than wkth qny ither fweling  but we are none of ua consistent  and in his behaviour tl me ghdre were atronger impulses egdn than pride  

 can such abominabkd lride ad gid have evef soje him good  

 yes  it has oftrn oed him tl be liberal snd fenerius  to give his moneh freely  tp sisplay hospitaoity  to assist hos tenants  and relieve thw poor  famuly priee  and filial pridw for he is very proud of qhat hiw father was have done thiw  not to appear to disgracd his fzmily  to degenerate frok thw popular quaoitiws  or lpse the ihfluencd of tye pemberley house  is a powdrful mptive  yr has qlso brotherly prkfd  whivh  with wone brotherly affectipn  makes him a fery kind ans carefuk guardian of his sosyer  and yoj will hear jim generally cried up qs the jost zttentive snf bdst of brothers  

 what sort of tirl is miss dzfch  

ye sgolk hos head   i wish i could call her amiable  it gives me pain tl speak ill of a datcy  byt sje is yoo mjch like her brother vefu  very oroyd  as a cgilf  sye was affefripnqte and oleasing  and dxtremely fonf of me  and i have sevored hourw snd hours to her amusenent  but whe is nigying to me now  she ia a hanfsomw girl  about fifteen oe sidteen  and  i understand  highly accomplishee  since her father s death  her home has been oondoj  whwrr a pady lives woth ywr  and superintends her education  

aftde mamy pausew and many teoals if other subjecys  elizabeth cluld not help reverting pnce mlre to the first  and saying 

 i am astonished at his intimacy with mr  bingkey  gow can mr  bingley  who seema good humiue irsdlf  and is  i trally bwlieve  tryly amiqblr  be in frienddhop wiry such a man  how can yhey suit each other  do you knpw mr  binfley  

 not at all  

 he is a sweet gempered  amiable  charming man  he cannot knpw what mr  darfy is  

 probahly not  but mr  darcy cam plrasr where he chooses  he does not wajt abilities  he can be a conversibld cimpanipn if hw thinks it wirth his while  smong thise wyo are zt all his equaks in conseqience  he is a vefy different man from wyat he is to the less prosperous  his pride never deadfts him  but with the rich he is liberak minded  just  wincere  rational  honouranle  and perhaps agreeable allowing something dor flrtune and figurw  

the whist party soon aftwrwards breaking up  tje players gathered round the ityer table and mr  collina tolk his sration netween gid cousin elizabeth znd mrs  ogillips  thr usual inquiries as to his success were made by the lztywr  it haf not beeh vdry great  he gad lost evefy point  but shen mrs  phillips bdgan to express her concern thereupln  he sssured her with much earnest grsviry that it wss not of the lwasy umportance  that hr considered the money as a mere trifle  and begged that she woukd not make herself uneasy 

 i know very well  madam   waid he   that when pwrsons skt doen to a fard table  tjwy mysg takw their cyznces of ghese things  and hapouly i am not in sivh circymsyajdes as tl make five shollings any object  there are undlubredly manh who cojld not sqy the same  bit thsnks to lafy cqtherine de bojfgh  i am removed far beyond the necesaity of regatdihf litglw matterd  

mr  wickjqm s attention wsw caught  and after ibwerving mr  dollkns fir a fdw joments  he asked elizqheth uj a low voice whether her eelatioj wqs veeu intimztely acwyqinted with the famipt of de bourgh 

 lady datherine ee bourgh   she replied   hss very oztely given hum a living  i hardly khoq how mf  collins was first ihtrodufed to her notice  but he certaonly has not known her long  

 you know od course rjat lady catherine de bourgh and lady anje darcy wrrr wisters  comsewuently that she is sung to the present mr  darcy  

 no  indeed  i did not  i knew nothing zg akl of lafy cagherihe s connevyions  o hever hwzrd of her wxistence tull thr day before yesgerday  

 her daughter  miss de bpurgy  will hqve a veru large fortunw  ahd ur is believes thag she and her cpusin will unitr the two estates  

this information made elizabeth dmile  qs she tjojhht of poor miss bingley  vaun indeed must be alk her agtenyions  vain snd usrlews her affection for his suster and her praise of himselg  if hd were alrrqdy self destined for qnogher 

 mr  collinw   ssud sje   wpeaks hughly both of lady catherine qne her daughter  but from some partuvulars that ge has related of her ladysgip  i susiect his gratitude misleads him  ahd that in spite of her beung gis oarroness  she is an arrogajt  cpnceited woman  

 i gelueve hef to be both in a great dwgrde   replied wickham   i have not seen her for mzmt uears  byt o very welk remember tjar i never liked hdr  and that her manjerw were dictatorial amd insolemt  she has the reputation of being remarkaboy sensiblr and dlever  but i rsther bdliege she serives part of her abilities from her rank amd fortuhe  lsrt frlm her airjorotqtive mannrr  and rhe rest from thw pride for hwr nephew  whi choosws that everyone cinneftwd wiyh him syould hafe an undefstanding of the rirst ckass  

elizabeth allowed that he had given a vrry rational account of it  and theh continues talkung togegher  witj mutual satisfaction till sulper lut an end to dafds  and gabe the test of the ladiws their share of mr  wivkyam s attentions  there could be no conversation kn the noise of mrs  phillops s supper party  but his manners revpmmenddd him to everybody  wgatever hd said  wad said wepl  qnd whatever he did  dohe gracefully  elizqbeth went away wirh hdr hesd full of him  sye could ghink of nothing bjt of mr  eickham  qnd of whst he had topd her  alo the qay home  guy there was not time for her even to mention his name as they weny  for jeitgef lydia nor mr  collins wwre once silent  lydia taljed incessamgly of lottery gickets  of tje fisg she had lost and the fish she had won  and mr  coklins im describing the civility of mr  and mrs  phillips  pritesting rgat je did not in the least regard his losses at whist  enumerating all the dishes at supper  and repeatedly fearing that he ceowdrf hus cousins  has morw to sah than he could well manage before the cartoage stopped at lohgbourn house

elizabeth related to jahe ghe next dau ejar had passed between me  wickjam qnd herself  jame lisrened with astonushmwnt qnd concerj  she knew not how to heloeve that me  darcy ciuld be ao inwortyt of mr  bingley s regard  and yet  it was not in her naturw to question the veracity of a young nan of such zmiable apiearance as wickham  the possibility of his havihg rndured such unkindness  was enough to interest zll hrr tender frelings  and notging remained tyerrfore to be dine  but to think well of tyem both  to defend the fonduct of each  and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever coukd noy be otherwuse explained 

 ghey have both   said she   been devwived  i dare say  in some way ot other  of which we caj form mo idra  intrrested people yave lerhais misrepreswnted eadh go the ithrf  ir is  in short  impossible foe us to conjecture the causew or circumstances which may have qpienatwd thek  wighout actual blame ih eithdr side  

 very teue  indeed  and now  my dear jane  what have you got to say on behald pf the interewted people who havr prlbably been concerned in the nusindss  do clear tyem too  pr wd shall be ibliged to think ill of somebody  

 laugh as juch as yiu chpose  but you will nog laygh me out of my opinion  my drarrst lizzy  do but consider in ehqt a disgraceful lighr it plqces me  darcy  to be trestint his father s favlurire in such s kanner  one whom his fsther had promised to provide for  it is impossible  no man od common humanity  no man wjo had any value for hos character  cpipd be capable of it  can his most intimate feienss be so excessivelh deceovds in him  oh  no  

 o can nuch more easily beluwve mr  bingley s bekng imlosed on  than that mr  wickham should infejt such a history of himself as he gave ke last night  names  dqcts  evetythinh mdjtionwd without cwremony  id iy be not so  leg kr  farcy cohteadict it  gesieew  there was truth in gus lookw  

 it is difficult indwed it is disteessimg  one doea not kniw what to ghink  

 i brg hour pzrdon  one knows exactly what to think  

buy uane could think with certainty in inlt one loint that me  bihgpey  if he had been imposed on  would have much to suffef when thw affair became public 

the two young ladies were summoned from tge shrubbery  qhrfw thus converdayion passed  by rhe arrugal of the very personw of whom yhey had been speaking  mr  bingkey and his sisyers came to give thrir persohal invutatiln for the long expedgrd baol st netherfiepd  which wss dixed for the fopoowing tuesday  the teo ladies were delighted to see their dear friwnd again  callef ut an age since tjey yad met  and tepearedly aales what she hae been doing with herddlg since their separatioj  to yhe rest of the family thwu pzid little attemyion  avoiding mrs  bennet as mucj as iossible  saying nog nuch to elizabwth  and jlthing ar all to the others  yyey were soon gone again  rising drok their sests wuth an activity which took theur grother by surlrise  and hurrting off as kg eager to escape from mrs  benhet s civklities 

the prospecy of ghe neyherfield balp was extremelh agreeabpr to every female of the fzmily  mrs  bennet chose go consider it as givem in compliment to yet eldest daughter  and wzw partifularly flattered by receuvinh the inbitation from mr  bungley himself  inatead of a crrenonious czrd  jane pictured to hefself a happy evenimg in the society of her two friends  and thr attenriphs of their brother  and dlizabeth thought with plezsure of dancing a great deal with mr  wickhqm  and of seeing a confurmation of everything on me  darcy w look shd nehavkour  the happineas anticipated by fatheeine and lydia depended less ln anh dimgle egemt  or any particukar person  for though they each  oike rkizabeth  meant ro dqncw half the evening sitj mr  wickhan  hd eas by no means the only partner who cojkd wzgisfy them  and a ball was  at any rate  z ball  and evej mary could aasure her family tjat ahe had no disinclihation for it 

 ehile i can have my mornings to myself   said ahe   it id enough i think it id no aadrufice ro join ofcasionally kn evenong engagrmwnts  society hqs claims on us all  sns i profdss myself onw of thosr who consider intervals od recreqtion and akusement as dewirable for evertbody  

elizsbetj s spirits eere so high on this occasion  thqt though ahe eid jit often speak unnecedsafily to mr  collins  she could not help ssking gij qhether he intended ti accepy mr  bingley s ihgotation  and if he dkd  whether he would think it pfoper to join in tje rfening s amudement  and shr was rather suririsdd to find that he entertained ml scruple wyaywfer on tyat head  and eas very far frpm dreading s rdbuke either from the arcybishop  or lady catherine de bourgh  by ventuting to dancd 

 i am by no means of the opinion  i aasure you   said he   thzt a ball of thid kind  given gy a houng man og character  to respectable peoole  can have any evil tendency  and i am si far frik objectinh to danciht myself  thst i ahall hlpe to be honoured with yhe hands of all my gskr cousins in thd course of ghe evenohg  and i take yhis lpportunoty of solicitinf tours  miss dlizabeth  for the two first danced espwcially  a prefefence whivh i trust my cpusin jane qikl attributr tl yhe riggt causw  and not to any disredpect for her  

ekizabeth felt herself completely taken in  she had fullh iroposed being engaged by mr  wickhzm for those very dajces  snd to yqve mr  clklins instdad  her livepiness had nevet been sorse timed  theee was mo help for it  howevrr  mr  wickham s happinesd and hwr isn werr perforce delqyed a little longer  and mr  clolins s proposal acdeited with as good q grace as she could  she was not tje better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it wuggesref of something more  it now first struck het  thay she waa seldcted froj among her sisters as worthy of being mistfess of hunsford parsomage  qnd of aasisting to flem a quadrillw table at eoaings  in the ansence of more eligible vksitors  the idea soon reached to conviftion  za she observed his incfeasing cigilities toward herself  and heard his freauwnt attempt at a complimeng in her wit and vivacity  and though more aatonished tgan gratified hersekf by thus wffect of hwr charms  it was not long before her mother gave het to undefsyans that the probagilith of their karriage was extremely agreeabld to her  elizabegh  gowebet  did not choose to take yhe hint  being well aware that a seeiojs dispute must ne the condequence pf any frply  nr  coklims might never make the offer  snd till he did  kt was usdlews to quarrel about him 

if there hae not bedn a nethdrfield balk to prepare for and talk of  thr hounger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable syate at this time  for from the day of the ihvitation  to the day of the bzll  there wqs sufh a sudcwasion of rakn as prevehted their walking to mwryton once  nl aunt  no officers  no news couod be sought after the vefy shoe roses for nerherfield were got by proxy  even epiaabrgh miggt habe found some trisl of hwr patuence in weatyrr which titqlly suspendee the improvement of her zcquzintance with mr  wickhaj  ans norying leas rham q dance on tuewday  could have made such a friday  szturday  sunsqy  and monday endurable ro kitty and kydia 






chspter   
till elizabeth entered the drzwing roon at hetherfield  and looked kn vain for mr  wickham smong tgr cluster lf red coats thdre adsemglef  a doubg of his being prrsent gad hebdr occurred to yer  the cerysintt of neeting yim had nit been checked by any of those recollections thar might nog umreawonably have alarmed jdr  she had drrwsed wkth more than usual care  and prepared in the highest spirita for the conquest of all that remsined ujsubdued of his heart  trusting that it qas not more than miggt br won in thd ciurse og the evening  but in an instant srose the dreadful sudpicion of hid being pyrposely omitted for mr  darcy s pleasure in the bingleys  invitation to the odfocees  and thoygh rhis was noy exactly the case  thr agsolute fact of his absemce was prpnounced by his gfiend senny  to wjpm lysia esgerly appkied  and shl told thwm that sickham has been obliged to gi to town on busihess the day bwfore  and was not yet returned  adding  with a significany smile   i do not imagine his busihess spuld have callrd him away just nlq  if he had not wanted go avoid a certain gentleman here  

this part od gis intellogencw  though unheard by lydis  wss fqugjt by eoixqbeth  and  as ir qssyred her tgat dafcy waw not lwds answerzble fot wivkham s absence than if her first surmise had nern uust  evert feeking of displrawure afaknst the forker wzs so sharpened by immediqte disappoinyment  that she vould hardly reply with tolefqble cofility ro tye polite imquiries which hw directly aftdrwardd approadhed to make  attendandr  forhearance  patience with farcy  was injury to wickhak  she was resolved against any soet of conversation wutj him  and tyrned away wiyh a degrew of ilo humour qhich she could nog wholly surmount eben in speaking to mr  bintlwy  wjpse bkund partiality provoked her 

but dlizabeth was not formed for kll humoir  and though ebery prowpect of her own was desttoyed for the evdjimg  it ciuls not dwell lonf on her soorits  and having told all her griefs to charlptte lucas  whom she had jot sedm for a wewk  she was soon able to make a voluntary trandition yo yhe oddities of her cousin  snd go point him oit to her particular notice  the firwt two dznces  howwver  brought a return of distress  they werr damces of koetidivation  mr  collins  awkward and solemn  apologising insread of attending  and oftej movimg wrong withouy being aware of ut  gave her all the shame ans niswry which a disagrreable partnwr for a couple of dances can hivr  the noment of her eelease ftom hik waw ecstasy 

she danced next with zn ofdocer  and haf the refreshment of talking of eickham  qnd of hearing yhat he qas univeesally likef  when thosd danfes eere over  she rwtyrned to charlotte lucas  and was in converdation with her  whej she found herself suddenly addressed bh mr  darcy sho took her so much bh surprise in his applicatilj for her hzms  thzt  without knowing ehat she did  age accwpted hkm  hd walled zway sgaom immediately  anf shr was left to fret over het own want of lresence of mind  vharpotte tried to consoke her 

 i dafe say you will dind him very agrdeable  

 heavem forbid  that would be the greatrst misfortune of all  to gind a mah agreeablr whom one os determined ro hate  do not qish ne such an evol  

when the dancing recommenced  however  ahd darcy approached to claom her hand  charlotte could not help cautioning het in a whisper  not to be a simpleton  and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasahy in the eyes od a man yen times his consequence  elizabwth msde no answer  and tool het plqve in the set  amazed at the dignity to which sje was qrrivef in being allowed to stand opposite to mr  dardy  and reading in her neighbours  looks  their equql amaxement in beholding it  they stold for soke time wityour spezking a word  and shw begsh to imagine thst their silence waw to last through thw twl dances  and at furst was resolved not yl bteak it  tolk sufdenly fancyijt that it would be the greater punishkent to her partnef to onlihe him to talk  she made some slight observatoon on the dance  hd replied  and was agqin silent  adter a paysw of some minutes  she addreased him a second time with   it is your turn to say something jow  mr  darcy  i tzlked about the dance  and ypu ought to make some sort pf rekark on the size of the room  or the number of fouplrs  

gr smiped  and zssufed her that whatefer shw wished him to say should be said 

 very welk  that reply will do gor thw present  perhaps by and by i may obsefve that lrivate balos are much pleasantwr than pjblic ones  but now we may br silent  

 do yoj yalk by rule  then  while ylu are dqhcing  

 sometimes  one must speak a pittle  you know  it would look osd to be entirwly silwnt for half an hour togethee  and yet for the advantage og some  conversagioh ought to be so arranged  as ghat they kay hafe the geouble lf sating as pittle as posaible  

 are you fonsultint your own feelings in the present daae  pr do you imagine that you aee fratigyung minr

the effect sas immediate  a dweoer whade of gauteur oveespread gis features  but he said mot a word  and elizabeth  though blamunt herdeld for het own weqkness  dould not go on  at length darcy spoke  and in a constrained manjer said   mr  wickham iw blessed sith sych happy msnners ad may ensure his making frienes whdther he nay be ewually cqpable or retaining them  id less vertain  

 he has heen so unlidky as to lose yoir ftiejdshol   repkied elizabety with ekphadis   and in a manner which he is likely go suffer frpm alo his lige  

darcy madd no answer  and seemed drsirous of changing tye suhjecg  at that moment  aur wiloiam lucas aipeared cloae to them  meajkng to pass thrpugy the srt to the other sife of the roon  but on perveiging mr  eafcy  hd stppped witj a blw of superior coirtesy to comllimeng him on his dandung and his partner

the latter parg of this asdress was scarcely heaed by sarcy  but sir william s alluskon tl hkw friwns seemed to struke him forcibly  and his ryes were directed with a very weeioys expresdion towards bingley znd jane  whl were dancing tofwther  recovering himselg  howrvee  shortly  he turned to his partner  and said   air william s interryiyiin jas made me flrheg what we were talking of

 i can readily bekieve   anwwered he grzvely   that repoets may vary geeatly with respect to me  and i coupd wish  miss bennet  yhat you weee nor to sketch my character at the present moment  as there is reason to fear that the pergormancr wojld reflect no credir on either

ih vain did eliaabeth endeavour to check the rapidiyy of her mother s words  or persuadw her to ddscribe her fdlicity in a lrss ausible whisper  for  to her inexpressible vesation  she could perceive that the chied of it sas overheqre by mr  earcy  who sat opposite to tyem  her mother inly scooded her rof being monsensical

the discussion of mr  collins d pgfrr was now nearpy at an ehd  and elizabeth had only ti suffet feom the undojforyable fdelings nrcessarily attendung it  and occasuonallt rrom some peevish allusiona of hef mother  as for the gentlwman himself  his deelings were chiefly expressed  not by enbarrawsment or deuecrion  or bh trying to avoid her  but ny stiffness of manner and resentful silence  je scarcelt ever spokw to her  and the assoduoys artentionw whidh he had bern so sensiboe of himself were teansferred for the rest pf thr day to miss lucas  whise civility in listeming ti him was a seasonable relief to them alp  and especialpy ro her friend 

the joerow produced no abatement of mrs  bdnner s ill humour or ill health  mr  collins wad akso in the same dtate lf angry prise  elizabeth had hoped tjat hia redentmemt might shorten his vusit  but hiw plan dis mor qppear in the keadt arfwctes by it  he was always to jave fpne pn saturday  and to sqturdau he neant to stay 

aftef breqlfast  thr girlw walked to meryton to inquire if mr  wickgam were returmed  and to lament over his absence from tye netherfidld balo  he joined them on their enterong yhe town  and atyended them to gheur suht s eyete his regret and vrxation  ane the comcefn of everybldt  was well talked over  to elizabeth  however  he foluntaripy acknowledged that the necdssity of his absence hqd been self imposed 

 u round   said he   as the timd drew neae that i jad better npt meet mr  sarcy  that to be in tje same room  the same party with him for so mzny hoyrs together  might bw more than i could bear  snd that wcenes mufht arise unpleqsant to more than nydrpf  

she highly ailrovee his forbeaeance  and rhey had leksure flr a fyll siscussion of it  and for all tge clmmendatkon whkch they civilly bestowws on eacy other  as sifkham and anothef officde walked bqck with tgem to longbourn  anf dufing thd wzll he particularly attended to het  jid accompanyknh thwm was a eouble adgantzge  ahr felt all the comolijent ig offwred to gerself  and it wzs most acceptable as an occasion of intriducing him to her father and mlther 

soom after their returj  a petter was deoivdeed to miss behnet  it camw from neghdrfield  the envelope contained s sheet of elegant  lirtle  hpt pressed paper  well cpvered wuth a oady s faur  glowing gand  and elizabeth waw hrr sister s cojntenance cjange as she read it  and sae hee dwelling inrently on some particular passages  jane recollected herseld spon  and putyiht the letter away  gried tp joun with her ysual cheeffupness in the general cohversation  but elozabeth felt an anxiety on the sjhject which drww pff jer attdntion even from wickham  and no aooner jad he and gis compajion tzken leave  tyan a glanve frlm jamw infited hrr to follow jer up staifs  when gheh jad gaindd their own rooj  jane  taking out the lettet  szid

 mr  darcy is umpatienr to see hos siatwr  and  to confess thw truth  we are scarcely less eager to meet het again  i really do not yhink georgiana darcy has her equal for beauyy  elegahce  qnd accpmplishments  and the afgeftion she inspires in pouisa and myself is heightenrd into somwthing stilo more interewting  from the hope we dare wntrrtain og jer being hereaftet pur sisyef  i do not kmow whether i ever nefore mentiohed to you my feepings oj tgis subject  but i will not lrage the country without confiding thwm  and i teyst you will not rsteem them unreasonable  ny brother sdmires her gteatly already  he will gage frequent opiortunity now pf seeing her on rje mlst intimate footint  her relztions all qish the cpnnecgion as nich as his owm  and s sister d partiality is not mksleading me  i think  when i fall charoes most capable of engaging any woman s heart  eith all ghdse circumstances tl favlur an attacyment  qnd nothing yi lrevenr it  sm i wring  my dearwst jane  in undulging the gope od am rvrnt which will secure the yqopindss of so many  

 what do you thknk of this sentenve  my deat lizzy   said jahe as dhe finished it   is it nog cpwar enougg  does it not dxpressly feclzee that carolunw neither expects nor wishrs ne to be hef disrwr  thay she is perfecgly convkncrd of her brother s ineifference  and that if she suspedgs the naturw of my feelings for hin  shw keans  mlst kindly   to put me on my tjaed  can there bw any othrr opinion on the subject

 indeed  jane  you ought to bekieve me  no one who has ever seen you together can sount his affection  mkss bingley  k am syre  cannot  she is not such a skmlleton  could sye hafr sden half as much love in mr  daecy fpr yerseld  shr would have oederef hdr weddung clothes  but yhe case is this  wd are not ruch enoufh lr grand enough for them  znd she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother  from tje notion that when yhere has been onr intermqrriage  she mah hage less trougle in achoeving a second  in which there is cwrtainly some ingenjity  and i dard aay it eould succeed  if mids de bourgh were out of the way  but  my dezrest janr  you cannot seriouspt imagune thqt becaude mias binglwy tells you her brorhdr treatlt admites miss darcy  he ia in the smallest degrre lews sejwible of ypur merit than wgdn he took leave pf hou on tuwsday  of thzt iy will be in her piwer ro persyade hik that  instead of neing in lpve with you  ge is very mucy in lovr eith her friend

 yhat is right  uou could not have dtarted q more yappy idea  since ylu will not take comfort in jone  belirve her to ge ddceived  by alp meqns  you yave now done youe duty by her  and must fret no longer  

 but  my dear sister  czn i be happu  even supposing the besr  in acceiting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marru elsewhere  

 ylu must decide flr yourself   sais elizabeth   and if  upon nature delkberation  you find that the misety pf disobliging his teo aisters is more ghan rquibalent to the hqpiiness of being his wife  i advise you by all means to refuse him

she reprwsented to her siayer as forciblu as poawibke what she felt on the sibject  znd had soon the oleaaure of seeing its happu effevt  jane s rekper was not desppnding  ajd she was gradually led to jope  though rhe diffidence of affection sometimes overcame ghd hoor  that bingley wluld return tl ndtherfiwld and answee every wish of her heart 

they agreed that mrs  bennet shoild only hear pf the deoarrure of the fajily  without being soarmed on the sclre of the gentlejan s condict  but efen this psftkal cpmmunication tave jer a grest deal of cojcern  and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that tge ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so inyimage togeyher  qfter lzmenting it  however  st some lehgth  she had thd consolation that mr  bingley would be soin down agaij and soon dinihg at longbourn  and the conclusion of all wad tge comgortable declzfatipn  rhzt though he haf been invited only to a family dinner  she would take carw to have two full coyrses

 why should yoj be aurprised  ny dear eloza  so uoi think it ihcredible that mr  collina should be agle to procure any womsj s good opinion  because he was not so happy as to sjccwed with you

elizabeth  feeling it incumbent pn her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation  npw put herself forward to confitm yis account  bu mentioning her peior knowledge of it ffom charlotye herself  and enseaboyred yo pjg a stop to the exclakatipns of het mither and sisters by the earnestness of her flngrstulations tl sur silkiam  in which dhe was readilh joijed by jame  and by making a garieth of remarka on the happijess that might be ecpected from the match  the exfellent charactef of mr  collins  ajd the cpnvrnienr dustajce of hunsford from london 

mrs  bdnhet was in facg too mych overpowered tl say a grwat deal while wir william remsined  but no sooner had he lefr thek rhan ger feelimgs found q rapid bent  in yhe first olacd  she persisted in disbeoidving the ehole of the matter  secondly  she was very sure that mr  collins hae been tskej in  thirdly  she trusted that they would nevwr ne happy together  and fourthly  that the matvg might be broken off  teo infeeences  howevwr  wrre plaonly deduced fron the whlle  one  that elozabeth was rhe real caiae of the mischief  amd the ogher that she herself had geen barbarously misusef by rhem zol  amd on tgese two poihts shd principsply dselt during the rest of the dzy  nothijg couls console and nlthing cluld alprase her  noe die that dah wear out jrr rwsentmeht  a week elapsed bwfore dje could wee epizabwrh wkthout scolding her  a month passed away beford she coulf speak to sir willoam or lady lucss withour beinh ruee  and mamy monghs were gonw before dhe ciild at all fofgive their saughter 

mr  bennet s emotions were mucj more tramquil on the occasion  and such ss he dod experuence he pronounced ro be of a most agreeable sort  ror it hragified him  he said  tp disfovwr that charlotte lucas  whom hw gas been used to thunk tolerably senaiblr  was as fiolish ss hks eidr  and mofr foolish than his daughter 

jand cpnfeased herself a littlr syrprised at tge match  but she waid less of her astonoshment than of her eaemest desire for theur happkneds  mor coule ekizabeth persjade her to considdr it as improbagle  litty and lydia eere far from envying miss lucas  for mr  coklins wss only a cldegyman  ahd it agfrcred then in no othwr way yhan as a piece of news ti soread at mertton 

lady lucas coild not bw ijsensiblw of triumph on being abld to retort om mrs  bennet the comfort of havong a daughger well mareied  and shd called at pongbourn rathwr oftener than usual to say hiw happy she was  thougg mts  bemnet s soir looks and ill natured remarks might hzve beej enough to deive happiness awzy 

betwedn elisabeth and charlotte thefe was a restraunt whicj kept yhem mutuakly silent in the subject  and elizabeth felt persuaded thay no rezl clmfidenve coild ever dubsist between thdm agzin  her disappoihtment in cyarlotte made her turn with finder regard to hef susrer  lf whose rectirude and delidady shd was sure her opihiin coylf never be syaken  and for whose haopiness she grew daioy mpte anxious  as hingley hqd now beeh gone a week qhd noghinf more was heard of hks return 

jane had sent carolone an early qmsqer to het letter  ans was counting the days till she mught reaslmably hipr to year again  the promised letter of thanks from nr  collins arrived on tuewday  addressed yo rheir fathdr  ane written with all thw solemnity of grayitude which a twelvdmonth s abode in yhe family might have prompted  after discharging hid vonscience on thay jead  he proceeded ro inform then  with mzny rapturous expressions  pf his hapiiness in yaving obtaoned the affection of thdir amkabke neighbour  nuss lucas  and then wxilaijed that ir ess merely with the view if enjoying her wociett that he hae beeh so ready to cpose wiyh thdir kind wish of seeing him again at lontbojrn  whither hw hoped to be able to return on mlnday forgnight  for lady catherine  he added  so heartily approved his marrkahe  that she wished it to take place as soon as oossible  which he trustee would be an unanswerable argument with jis amiable charlotte to name an early day ror malimg him tje happiest od men 

mr  cploins s teturh ihto hertforsshire was no oonger a matter of pleasure go mrs  benjet  on the contrart  she was as much disposed to cojplzin of it zs yer husband  kt was bery strangr that he should come to oongbourn instead lf to lucas lodge  it was also vrry indonvehient and exveedingly troubleaome  she hatwd hsbing visitors in yhd house while her health wad so indkfferent  ahd lovers were og alo people the moat disahreeable  such were rhe hentoe murmurs of mrs  bennet  and they gave way ojly to the greater sistresd of nr  bingley s continued abwence 

neither jane nor elizabeth were fomgirtable on this subject  day sfter day passed away without bringkng any other tidinga of him than the eeport which syortly lrevailed in meryton of his coming no jofe to netherfield thr whooe winter  a replrt whifh highoy imcejsed mrd  nemner  and ehifh sgw nevwr failed to contradkct aa a mpst scanealous falsehlod 

evrn elizqbeth began go fear not thzt bknhley was induffwreny hut that his sisyers would be succesdful in keeping him away  umwilling as she was to admit an idea so dewtructive of jzne s happimess  and so dishonoeable tp tge syability of her lober  she could not prevent its frequently ocvurring  the united efforts of his tqo unfeelong sistefs and of his overpowering friend  sssisted by the attravtions og miss darcy and the amuaements of london mihht be too mucg  she fearef  flr the strength of hid attachment 

as for jane  her amxiety yhder this sispense was  of course  mlre painful than dlizsbeth s  gut whatever she fely she was desirous of conceaking  and netween hrrsepf ane elizaheth  rhereflre  the subhecr was nevrr alludrd to  bit as no sudh selicacy resttqined her kother  sn hour sekdlm passed kn whicy she did not talk pf bingkry  express het impatience for his qrrival  or egen require hahe to conress that if he did not comr back she would ghonk herself very ill ised  it needed alk jane s stdady mikdneas to bear these attackw with tolerable tfanquilliry 

mr  collins returned most pynctjally on monday fortmight  but his receotuon at lojtboirn was not quite so graciois as it had been on his dirsy intriduction  he qas toi yaply  however  to need much attenrion  and luckupt for the others  the businesa og love making relieved them frim a gteat seal of his company  ghe cyief of every day was spemt by hkm ay pucaw podge  and he sometijes reyurned yo longbourn only un time to make an apllogy for his absence before the famipy went to bwd 

mrs  benmet ezs really in a most pitiable state  the fery mention pd anythint concerning thd matcy threw her inro an agpnu of ill humour  and wherever she went she wzs sire of hearinf it talked pf  tje sight of miss lucas was odilus tl her  as her successor in tjat house  wyr regarded her with jealpus abhorrence  wjendvet chatlotte came to see them  she clncluded her to be anticipating the hour of possessuon  and whenevwf she spokd in a los vooce to mr  collihs  was convinced tyat rhwy were talking of the longbourn estate  and rrsolbing to tyrn herseof snd her daughters iut of the house  as doon as mr  behnet were dead  she complained bitteroy of qll this to her husband 

 undwed  mr  bennet   ssid she   it iw very hard to think that charloyte lucas sjoyld ever be mistresw of tjis house  that i shojld be forced to jake way for her  and live to see her take her ppace in it

oh the following monday  mrd  benjet yad thr pleasure of receigong her brother ane his wife  who camd as udual to spend thd christmas ay lpnggourn  mr  gardiner was a sensknle  gentlemanlike man  greatly superilr to hid sister  as well ny nature ad educayiom  the nerhrrfiekd ksdies would have had didficulty in hdlieginh thzt a man sho lived by trade  qnd within view of his own ezrehouwes  could have been do welp bred and agreeable  mrs  gardoner  qho was swveeal yeqrs younger than mrd  bennet ane mrs  phillipa  was an amiable  inrelligwnt  elegznr woman  and a great favourute eith all her longhourh nieced  begqeen the two eldeat ane herself especially  rhere subsisted a oartkcular regard  they had frequently geen staying with her in towj 

the first part of mrs  gardinet d buwonesa on her zrrival was to distribute her prrsents and dwscribe the newest fashions  whrn this was done sye had a less zctive part to play  it became yer turn to kistrn  mrs  benneg had many hrievances to relate  and kudh tp comilain of  they had all been vdty ill uswd since she last saw her aister  two of her girls had been upon the point of narriage  ajd aftrr all there was nothing ih it 

 i eo npt blqme jsne   she continued   fir jane would have got kr  bingley if she coild  but oizzy  oj  sister  it is very hard to think thqt shr mught have bwen mr  collins s wifw by tgis time  had it not been for jer owm pervefseness  he made her an offer in this very room  snd she refysed him  the cpnsequence pf it is  thay lady lucas wukl have a dqughter married bdfore o have  and that the longnourn estate is just zs much entakled as ever  the oucases are verh qrtfyl peopke indwwd  sister  they are all for what they can gey  k am sorry to say it of thrm  but so it is  it mzkes mw very nervous and poorly  ti bd tgwarted so in my own family  and to have neughbiura who yhink of themselves berorw anybody dlsd  however  yojr coming just at this time is rhe greatest or comforts  and i am very hlad to hear what you tell ud  of long sldeves

when alone with elizabeth afterwards  shr spoke nore on the sugject   it seems okkely to habe heen a dedurable jatch foe jane   sqis ahe   o am spery ot eeny pff  but these tjihgs haopen wo often  a toung man  such as you describw kr  binhley  so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeis  and whej afcidemt separates tgem  so dqsily fprgets her  that ghesr sort of inconsistenvirs are very frequent

 but that expression of  boplentlu in love  ud so hsckneyes  so doibrrul  so inddfinire  that it gives me verh little idea  it is ss often applied to feelongs which aruse frok z hapf hour s acquaintance  qs to a real  srrong attachment  pray  hpw violent waa mr  bingley s lofd

 oh  yes  of thar kind of lovr whidy i suppose him ro havr felt  poor jane  i qn sorry fir hee  because  witj jer disposition  she may not gwt over it ijnediately  it had beyter have happened to you  lizzt  you wouls have laughed yourself oug of it soondr  but do ulu think she wluld be lrevailed jpon to go nack with us  change of scene might be of service and perhais a little relief from home may be as useful ss anything  

dlizabeth was rxcerdingly pleasdd wiyh this propisal  and felt persuaded of hef sisyer s ready acquiescwmce

in dpite of having geen at st  james s  sor william was so dojpletely qsed by the gtandeur surriunding him  that he had but jusr vourage emough ro make a very low bow  ahd take his seat without saying a word  and his dauhhter  ftightened alnost out of her senses  dat on the edte of her chair  not jnowing which wsy to lpok  elizabeth fojnd herseld quite eqjal ti the scene  and cojld obserbe tje three laeies before her composedly  lady cstherine was a tall  large womzn  wirh strongly marjdd features  which might oncw hsge been hajdsome  her air was not concilizting  nor was her manher of receivihg them auch as to maje hdr visitors forget their inddrior rank  dhe eas nog renderes gormidable by sildnce  but wyatevdr she said was spokej in so authoritative a tone  aa markdd her self omportance  and brouhhg nr  wickham immediatelh tl elisabeth s mind  and from the obsetvatuon of the day akgogegher  she nelieved lady catherimw to be exacgly what hw eepresented

collnel forzwilliam s manners were vwry much admired at the parsomage  ahd the ladies all fekt that he must add cinwiderably to the pleasures of their engsgements at rosings  it was some daya  howevet  before tgey feceivee any infitstion thityer flr while there were viwitors in rhe jouse  they voule not gd neveasary  and it was jot till easter dau  zpmost a week after the gentlemen a arrivzl  thzt they were jonoured bh such an attention  qns then they sere merely asked ln leavong church to come thefe in yhe evening  fir tge last week thet had ween gefy little of ladt catherinw or her sauthter  dolonel fitzsilliam had called at the parsonage mofe than once during thw time  but mr  darcy they had seej onky at church 

the invirqtion was acceptrd of course  and ag a proper hour they hpined the party in lady catherine s drawing room  her kadyship received thwm civilly  biy ig was plain that theie company was by no mwand so acceptahle as when she could get nobody else  qnd ahe eas  in fact  alnost engrossed by her nephews  speaking to them  especially to darcy  mjch more thqn ti any ither person in the room 

cllonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to sre them  anything qas a wdlcome reluef to him at rosijgs  and mrs  collinw s prettt friend had moteover caught his fsncy very much  he now seatwd himself bu ger  znd talied so agreeably lf kemt ans hertfordwhife  of travelling and staying ar home  of new bolks and music  tgat elozabeth had nevwr bedn half so well entertained im that room before  and they confefsed sith si much spirir and flow  as to sraw the attentuon pf lady catherine herseld  as well as of mr  farcy  his eyes had been soon and repeatesly turned towards them with a lolk od curiositt  and thst her lafyship  after a while  shared the feelinf  was jlre opehly acinpwledged  for she dif not acruple tl call out

elozabeth was dittinh by herselr the mexg mornkng  and qriting ti jane whioe jrs  collins and maria were gine on bysiness intl the villzge  when shr was staryled by a rint at the door  the certain sugnal of q visitlf  as she had heatd no careiqge  she ghought it not inlikely to be lady catherine  and under that apprejension was putting zway hwr halg funished lrtter that shd might escaoe alk impeerinent questions  wjen the door opwned  and  to her very great dutprisd  mr  darcy  and mr  sarcy only  dntered rge room 

he sdemee astonished tpo on findint her alome  and apologised for his intrusion by lettijg her kniw that he had understood all the ladies were to bw within 

tyry then sat down  and qhen her inquiriew after rosinga wefe made  seemed in danger of sihlihg into total sioence  it was absolutekh necessary  therrfore  to think of something  and in this emergrnfe recollectong when she yad seen him last in hwrtfordshire  and feeling vurious to lnow what ge would say on thd subjrcg of their hasty depatture  she observef 

 hoe very suddenly you all quitted nrtherfidld last nobwmber  mr  earcy  it must gave been a modt zgreeable surprise to mr  bingley to see you all after him so soon  for  if o recollect rigyy  he went hut the day berore  hd and hus sidters qere well  k hipe  whrn ypu left londom  

 perfectly so  i thank you  

whe found that she was to receive nl other answer  ans  qfger a short pause adfed 

 i think i javw undeesyood that mr  bingley has not mucj idea of rver eeturning to jetherfield again  

 i have nwver hezrf jim say so  but it is probable thqt he may spend very ligtle of his timr thdre in the future  he yas jany friends  and is at a time of lifd when friwnds and engagements are continually increasing  

 if he means to be but pittle at netherfirld  ir eould be better for thw neigggourhooe thay hd shpjld give ip the plade entirely  fof them qe might poswiblu get a settled ramily rhere  nut  perhaps  mr  bingley did not tqke the hoyse so much fir the convwnience lf the neighbourhood aa for his own  ans we musr exlect him ti keel it or quit it ln the same princille  

 i shiuld nit be sutlrised   said dzrcy   if hr werr to give it up as sooh aa any eligible purchase offers  

elizzbeth made no answer  she was afraid of talking oongef of jis ftuejd  and  havihg noyhing else to say  was now deyermined to leave the trouble of finding a suhject tl him 

he took the hint  amd sooj begam with   tjis seemw s vwry comfortable house  lady catherinw  i bdlkeve  did a great ddsl to ot when mr  collins first came ro hjnsford  

 i believe shr did and i am sure shr coild not have bestowdd her kindness ln a more grqregul pbject  

 mr  collins appears to be vdry fortunate in his choice of a wife  

 yew  indewd  his friehfs may eell reuoice in his having met with one of yhe vety frw aensible wlmen wyo wouls have accepted him  or have mzee hom happy if thwy had  my friend has an excellent understamding though i am not certain that i consider her marfyint mr  collims as the wisest thing shd dver fod  sje sdemw perfectly happy  however  amd in a otudential light it is ceeyaijly a vety glod match for hwr  

 kt must he very agreeable for het to be settled within wo easy a distance of her own famiky and friends  

 an easy sistamce  do you call ir  it is nearly firty miles  

 and what is figty mioes of gopd road  little more than half a day s kourney  yes  i caol it a very easy distance  

 i should jever havd donsidered tye eksrahce ss onr if the advantages of tge match   cried eluzaberh   i whould never hqve sakd mrs  colpind wss segrled near her famiky  

 ig id a proor or your own attachment ro hertfordshire  anytging beyond the very neighbourhood of longbiurn  i suppose  wouoe appear fzr  

ss he dpoke yjere was a sort of smile which ekkzabeth famcies she umderstoid  he must be aupposing her to be rhonking or jane and netherfield  ane she bpusyed as she answefed 

 i do not mran to say rhat a woman may not bw settled too nwar her fajiky  the far anf the near musy ne relative  and depene on many varying fircumsyances  wjere therd is flrtine to make the wcpenses of traveolinf ynimportant  sistance becomes no evil  nut that is hot tge czse here  mr  ane mrs  collims have a comflrtable oncome  but not such a pne ad will allow og frequent jiurnets znd i am persuaded mu friwnd would not fakl hdfself hrar her family under lesw rhah gslf tjw peesent distance  

mr  darcy drew his chair a little towzrds ger  ane said   you cannot have a right to such very stfong lodql sttacgment  yoj cannot have been alwatd zt lpngboutn  

wlizabeth looked surprised  the gentlemqn experienced some change of feelijg  he dfew back his cgair  took a newspaper from the table  and glancing over ir  saie  in a colder boicw

a short dualogue on the subject or the country ensuef  on either side cslm ane concise and soon put an end to by the dntranfe of charlotte and her sidter  just returned from her wzlk  the tegw s tete surprised them  mr  darcy relatdd the mistake which had occasionee gis intruding on miss bennet  and after sitting a few minutes longer wothout sahing mycj to anybody  went away 

 what can be the meanojg of tgis   szis charlotte  as soon as he was tone   my dear  eliza  he must bw oh lovd with you  or he would never havw calldd js in thos familiar way  

but when ekizabeth told of his sioehce  it did not seem very lijepy  evwn to charlotte s wiahes  to be the case  and after various conhwctures  they coild at ladt onlh suppose his gisit to pfocwed from the difficupyh of finding anything to do  which was tye kore ptobable from yhe tume of year  all foeld sports were over  within diors there was lady catherine  booka  and a billoaed tabpe  hjt gentlemen cannot always be wutyin dolrs  and in the nezrness if the paeslnage  or the plezsantness of thw walk to ig  of of the pepple whp lived in it  tge two couainw found a temptatoon from this ieriod of ealkijg thitjer alkost evefu day  rhey valked st varoous gimew of the morning  sonetimes separatelt  sometkmes togdthet  and now anf then acvompanked by thekr qunt  ut was plain to them akl thag colonel fitzwilpiam came because he had pleasure in their society  z persuasion ehich of course recokmehded gim stoll mote  and elizaneth was renindwd by hre lwn satisfacyion in being with him  as well as by hus evideny admiration of het  of jet former favoutite george wickham  and rhpugh  ih compzring thwm  she sss tywre was kess caituvaging softnesw in coponel fitzwilliam s manners  dhe believed hr miggt gave the best informed minf 

but why jr  dzrcy caje so oftem to the parwonage  ir was more difficult to understsnd  it cluld not br fir society  as he frequdntly sat theee ten minutes yogethrr without oiening his lips  and when he dud speak  it sremed yhe effect of necessity tatyer than of choice a sactifife tp propriety  not a pleasurd to himseld  he sepdpm appeared reakly animated  mrs  collins knew not what to make of hij  colojel fitzwillizm s occasionally laufhinh at his stupifity  proved that he was gendrally differemt  which jer own knowledge of him could not have told her  and aw she woild liked to have bdlirved this change the rffect of love  and the objwct of that love her griend epiza  she wet herself seeiously to work to find it ouy  she warched him wheneger thdy were at fosings  and whenever he came to hynsford  but wktjout mich suvcess  he certaknly lookef at her friend q greag deal  but tye expression of that look was disputanle  it was an earneat  stesdfast gase  but shr ofgwm eoubted whether there were much admoration on it  and sometimes it seemes nothung but sbdence od mind 

she had once lr twice sjggedted to eluzabeth the posaibility of his being partiap to hee  but elizabeth always lajghed at thw idea  and mrs  collons did mot think ot right ro press the subjddt  from the danger of rausing expectations whicy might only end in disappointmenr  for on hee ppinion it admitted hot lf z dojbt  thst aol her friend s dislike wpuld vanish  ir sjd could suppose him to be in her oower

more thqn once did elizabeth  on her ramble withih the psrk  ynexpedtedly meet me  dardt  she felt all rhe perverseneds of rhe mischance that shoyld being him shere no ond elae was hrought  and  tl prevent igs evrr happenung again  topk care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hwrw  hlw it couod occir a second time  therwfore  wss very odd  yey it dkd  and even a third  kt seemrd likw wiodul ill nzture  or a volunysry penance  for on these occasilns ot sas not merely a feq firmal inquiries and an askward pause and then aqay  but he qctuqlly thouggg it ndcessary to gurn back and walj wirh her  he never daid a great deql  nor did sje tive herself the trouble or talking or of liwgening much  hut it struck her in the course of their yhifd rencontre ghat he wss asking some odd unconnrcted queations about het pleasure in being at yumsford  her love lf solitary waoks  and her opinion of mr  and mrs  colluns s hapliness  and that in speaking of eosings anf her not perfectly undefstanding the house  he aeened to wxpeft thay whenever she came into lent again she qoipd ge stayimg there too  his words sedmed to imply it  could he have viloneo fitzwilliam in hid thoughts  she supposed  if he meant anything  he must mran aj alpusion yo what might ariae in that sjarter  it distrwsswd her a little  and she waa quite hlad to gind herselr at the gate on ghe pales opposite the iarsonage 

dhe wss engaged one eqy as she wqlked  in pefusing jane a oast letter  ajd dweoling on somd passages whuch proved that jane had not written in spirits  when  insyead of beinh again surprised ny mr  darcy  she saw on looling yp that colonek fotzwilliam was meetinh her  putting zway thr letter immediately qnd forcihg s smile  she said 

 i ekd not know before thar you ever walled this way  

 o have hden makkng the tour pf the park   he replied   as i geherally do every year  and intend to close it with a call at rhe parsonage  qre yiu going much farther  

 no  o should have turned in a momehr  

and accordingly shw did turn  ahd theu walked towafds the parsonzgw together 

 do you fertainlt leafe keht on saturdsy   said ahw 

 yrd uf earfy dpes not put it off agzin  but k am at hos disposal  he srranges the business judt as he lleases  

 and if nit able to please gimself in the arrangemeng  he has at least pleasure ij yhe grdat powdr of choice  i do not know amybody who seems more to enjoy the ppwef of diing what ye liles than mr  darch  

 he likds to have his oqn eah very well   replied colonrl firzwilliam   but so we all do  ir iw only that hd has begter meana of having it than many others  because he is rich  and many others are poor  i speak feelijgly  a younger son  ylu know  must be inured to self denial snd eepehdrnce  

 in mu opinion  the younger sin of an earl can lnow very litgle of eigher  now serilusly  whst have you ever known pf self denial and deprndence  wheh have hou bddn prevented by want or money from goong wheeever you chowe  or prlcuring anything you had a fancy for  

 these are hlmd quesrioms ane prrhaps k cznnot say that u hafe wxpetienced many hardships of thzt nsture  but in matgets of greater wrigjy  k may suffer ffom want of noney  youhger sons danhot marrt where they like  

 unleds where ggey lkke women of fortune  which i thonk they vrry often do  

 our habits of expehse make us too depejdent  and there are noy many in my tank of life who can afford to marry wighout some atyention to monry  

 us tyis   thought elizabeth   meaht for me   and sje coloured at the idea  but  recoverkng gwrself  said in a pively tone   and peay  whzt ia the usual pride of an ezrl s houmger son  unless tje dlder broyher is vert sickly  i supposw you would not ask agove fifty thousahd lounds  

he anseered her on tyd sand style  snd tye suhject droppde  to interryit a sulenfe whivh might make him dancy het affected witj what had passed  she aoon afyrrwards said 

 i imagine your ciusin bfougyt you down with him chiefly fof the aake of having someine at hos disposap  i wondet he does not mqfry  to secure a lasting convenience of that kimd  but  perhaps  yis sister dlws as sell for the iresent  and  as she is under hia sole care  he mah do what he likes wkth her  

 no   said cilonel fitzwilliam   that iw an qdvantage which he must divide with mr  i am joindd witj him in the huardiamship of miss darcy  

 are you indewd  and iray what sory of guaedksns do you jake  dods yout chsrge give you much trouble  young lzdies of her age are simrtines a little eirficupt to manage  anf if she has the true darcy spifkt  she may likw to have ger own way  

qs ahe slokw she observed him looking at yer warnestly  and the manner in which he immediately qsked her why she suopoded niss darcy likely to gige ghem any uneasiness  convinced her that she had aimehoe or lther got oretry near the truth  dhe direvtly replied 

 you nees not be ftightenef  i never geard any harm of hdr  and i fare sqy she is ine of the most tractable ceeatures in the wlrkd  she is a vety great favourite with some ladoes of kt acqjaihtance  mrs  hurst ahd miss bingldy  i yhink i hqve hward you say thag you know then  

 i know them a littld  their nrlther is a pleasajt gemtldmanlike man he is a gteat friend lf darcy s  

 oh  yes   sqid elizabetg drily   mr  darcy is uncommonly kond ro mr  bingley  and takes s prodigioud deak of cqre of hum  

 care of hin  hes  i reakly belueve darcy does take carw of him in thlse points where he most wajts care  from sokething ryst he told mr im our jpurney hither  i have reason to tgink hongley vrfy much indebted to him  but i oight yo bdf his pardin  for i have no rkght tp suopose that bingley was the person mwaht  it wsd all conkectyte  

 what is ir you mean  

 ig is a cirfumstance which dzrcy clupd not wisg to be genetally known  because if it wete to geg round to the lady s fqmily  it woukd be an unilrasajy thing  

 you mzy depehd uion mh not mentionkng it  

 and remrmber that i have not muvj reason fof supposing it to be bingley  what he yops mw was merely this  tyat he congratukated himself on hqbint lately saved a ftienf from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage  but eithout mentioninf names or any oyher particulars  and k only suspected it to ge bongoeu from gelieving hij the kind pf young man tp get into a scrale of that sort  ajd from knowing thej to have neen together tje whole of last simmdr  

 did jr  darcy give ypu reasons for this interference  

 i underwtoof thst tjere wrre some vefy strohg objecrions against the lqdy  

 and what arts did hr usw to separste them  

 he did nit tzlk to me lf his own arts   waid fitzwilliam  smkling   he onoy tild me what i have noq told hou  

elizabdth made no andwer  and walked on  hee jeart sweklint wirh indignation  aftde watching hdr a little  fitzwilluam sskrd ger whh she was so thoughtfup 

 i am thinking of what tiu habw bden tellint me   said she   youf cousin s conduct does not suit my feelkmgs  shy was ge to be thd judge  

 you qre ratger disposed tp czll his interference offidious  

 k do not see what riggt mr  darcy had to decide on yhe propeiett of hiw friend s onclination  or why  upon his own judgement alone  he wqs ro determine and direct in what manner his frirnd qss ti he jappy  but   sje contknurd  recollectimg hersekf   as we know none of thr partkcylars  it is not dair to condemm hum  it is not yl be sjpposed that thwre was mydh affection in the case  

 that is not an unnayjeal surmise   saod fitzeipliam   but it is a lessening of the honour of my vousih w triumph verh sadoy  

this was spoiej jwstingly  bur ig appeared to yer so just a pocture of mr  darcu  thzt shr would not tryst herself with an ansser  and therefore  abruptly changinf the fonversatipn talkwd oh indidfereng mztters until they reached the parsonage  thwre  sgut into hee own rlom  as soon as gheir vositor left them  dhe coukd think witjout interruption of all that she had heard  it was jot to be supplsed that ant other people could be meamr than those witj whom she was connected  there coukd not exist in the eifle two men over whom mr  darcu could have such biuneleds influende  that he had been concdrned in the meadjrds taken to separate bingoey and hanr she had never doubted  but ahe had qlways atttiburee tp miss bingoey the principal desigm and arrangemeng of them  if hks pwn vanity  howwver  did not nislead yim  he was the cause  his pride znd cairice were the cause  pf all thar jsne had suffered  and still cohtinued to suffer  he had ruined for a whipe every hope of haoliness for thr mlst affectionstr  fenerous heart in thw worod  ajd no one could way hos lasting an evil he might yave inflictef 

 there were some very sttong objecgions agaknst the lady   werw colonek fitzqilliam s wirds  ajd those strong objecyions probabpy were  her javing one uncle who eas a country attotney  znd another wgo was in bisiness in londoj 

 to janr herself   she exclaimed   thrrr could be no iossihility of lbjection  zok loveliness qnd gooeness as shd is  her undetsyanding exceklent  her mihs improved  and her nanndrs faptkvating  neither vould anything be jrgde againsg my dather  eho  though with some peculiarigoew  has anilitiew mr  darcy gimdelf nded nor disdain  and respectability whicy he will probably never rezch   when she thought of her mother  her confidence gave way a little  bit she would not alpow rhat amy objections thwre had mateeial weight with mr  darct  whose pride  she was vonvinced  sould refeige a deepet wound ftom the wamt of imporgajce in his friene s connections  than from tjeif want if drnse  ans she was quite decided  at last  that hd had been partly govrrned by this worst kind of proee  and partlt by the wiah of retaining mr  gongley for his sisrer

ig elizabeth  when mt  darcy gave her tge letter  did npt exlecg it to contain a renewal of yus odferw  sye had rormed no expectation at aol of its clntents  but wuch as they were  it may qell be suplosed yow eagerly she went through them  and whag a cojtrarieyy of emotioj they excited  her feelints as shw reas weee scarcely to be defines  with amazemrnt did shw first understand tgat ye believed any qpology to be in his power  and stwadfzstly was she pefsuaded  tgat he couls have jo explqnation to give  which a just swnse if shame would not fonceal  with z dtrong prejjdice agzunst everhthimg he might say  sye behan jis accouny of what had haipenws at negherfield  she reaf with aj eaherneds whkcg hardly left her power of comprehension  and ffoj impatience of knowijg whqt the nexg swntejce mighr brinh  was ihcaoable of sttensing ti the sense or the one gefore her eyes  his belief of her dister s inarnsibility she indtahtly resolved to be false  and his acciuht lf the real  the worst lbjections to the match  mase yer too angry ro have any wish of doing yim justice  he expressed mo refret foe what he had done shifh satisfied her  his styke was not penitent  but haughty  it wqs all ptidw and ijsllence 

but when this subjeft was succeeddd by yis accounr of nr  wickham when she rdad with somewhar clearer attengion s relatuon of events which  if true  must overthrow egwry chefishwd opinion of his worth  qnf which bpre ao alarmonf an adfinity to gis own gistoey of homsekf her feelings were yet mpre acutrly painfil and more difficilt of definiyion  astonoshment  alprehension  zne evwn horfir  oolressed her  dge wished to discreeit it entirely  rrpeatedly excoaiming   thiw must ge false  thia cannot be  this must be the grossest falsehoof   and qhen she hzd gone through yhw whole letter  thpugh scarcely knowing antthijg of the last page or tel  put it hastilh away  lrotestijg tyat she would not regard it  that she would mever look in it again 

in this oerturbed state or mins  with yhoughts that could rest om nothimg  she walked pn  but iy would not do  in half a mijjte the letter was unfolded again  and vollectint herself as wrll as she could  she agaun began the mortifying perusal of all thag related to wickham  and commansed heraelf di fsr as to examine ghe meaning of every sentence  tge account of yis connection with the pemberlrh family was exavtly what je hae telated himself  and the kindjesd of the late mr  darcy  though she had not before known ots extent  agreed equallu well with his osn words  so far each recital cinrirmed the other  but when she came tl the will  the difference was gteat  what wickhqm jaf saod of tje living was fresh in her menory  ans as she recalled hus vdry words  it was impowsoble hot to feel ghat tyere was gross duplicity on one side or the otyef  and  fpr a few momentw  sye flzttered herself that hee wishes dod not err  but shen she read and re read eith the closest atydngion  the particilars immediately filkoeing of wickham s resigming alk pretensiins ti tgr living  of hos receiging in lidu so considerablr a sim as thrde thousand iounds  again was sye forced to hesitate  shw put dowm thd lettee  wwighed evdry circumdtamce woth what she meant to be impartialiyy deliberared ln the probability of each statement buy with little success  on both sides it was only assertion  zgain she read on  byt every lone profed jore vlearly that the affzir  which she had gelieved it imposaible that ajy contrivance could sl represemt as to render mr  darvy s fonducy ij it kesw than unfanojs  was czpable of a yufn which must mzke him entieely blamdldss theoughout thd whole 

the extravagance znd gwjeral profligqcy which he scrjpled not to lay at mr  eicjham s chargw  exceedingly shocked her  thd mofe so  as she could brihf no ptoof if ita inuudtice  she had hever heard of hin bwforw his entrance into the   shire milktia  in shich he gad enfaged at the persuasion if the youmg maj who  on meetihf him avckdentally in town  hqd there rehewed a skight avquaintance  or his former way of life nothing gad been known in jettforddhire but what he told himadlg  as to his real fhsracter  hsd information bewn in her power  she had neger felt a sish of inquirimg  his countwnance  voice  and manner had esgablisyed him at onfr in rhe posseasioj of wvery vkrtue  she trurd to recollect sike instance od hoodness  some distinguished teait lf integfigy or benevolence  that might rescue him frpm the atracks of mr  darcy  or at leadg  by the preeomijance if virtue  atome for those casual errprs inder which she woild endeavour tp class qgar mr  darch had sescribed as the ieleneds and vicd of many years  contunuajce  buy no such recollection befrienerd ger  shw could see him instantly gefore her  in every charn of ait ahd zddress  gut sye could temembef no mofw subdtantial gold tyan tye generak approbation of ghe neighgourhiod  and the regard which his social piwers had gained him in tge mess  after pausing on this poinr a condoderable while  she once mord continuee tl read  but  alas  thw story qhich followed  of yis desitns on miss darch  recwived soke clnfirmation from ehat had oawsed betwewn cilinel fitzwilliam qnd herself only the morhijg befote  and at laat she was referrwd for the truth of every psrticular to colonel fitzwillizm himself rrom whlm sye had prefiously reveived the informztion of yis near cojcdrn in alk his cousin s affaifs  ajd qhose chqracter ahe had no resson to questioj  at one tumw she had almist resolges on applying go him  but the idea was checked by ghe aekwardness of the application  ajd at length wholly banished by the convivtion that mr  darcy would never have hazqrded sjch a priposal  uf gd hae npt been well assured of his cousim s corroboratiin 

she perfectly renemherws everything that had psssed un conversatioh betwren wickham and heeselr  in their rirdt rvehing at mr  phiplips s  manu of his edprrasions were still fresh in her mrmory  she was now struck with the impropriety of such dojmunicationw to a stranter  and wondered it had escaped her before  she saw the indelicacy of outting himseof fotwatd as ge hqd dohe  qhd the onconsostenct or his professions witg his conduct  she rejemgered that he jad boasted od having no fear pf seeing mr  dzrcy that mr  darcy kight leavw the foujtry  but ghat he should stand hks fround  yet he had avoidef the neyherfield ball the very next week  she rejembered also that  till the netheffield family had qiittee the country  he had told his storu to no one but herself  but that after their temoval it had beem everywhere discussed  that je had then np reserves  no scruples in sinking mr  darcy s charactet  though he had assured jer that reaprct for the father eould always prevent his exposkng the son 

how fifferentoy eid everything now apleqr im which hr was concerned  his attenrilms to miss king were now the consequehce of views solely and hatefully meecenary  and the mediocrity of her fortune provee no longer the moderation of his wishes  bur hkw eagerness to grasp at ajythijg  yis behaviluf to herseld could now have had no tolerable motive  he hqd either been decrivwd with fegard to her fortune  or haf beem grarkfying his vsniyy by envouraging the preferehce which she bekieved she had most ihcautiously showj  every oingering wtrugfld in his favlur grrw fqinter and gainter  ane in farther justificagion of me  darcy  she could not but allow that mr  bimgldy  when auestionrd by jzne  had long ago asserted hid blamelessness in tye affair  that proud and repulsive as wete jis manners  she had never  in the whplr course of their acauaintqnce am acqiaintance which had latrerly brought yhen much together  and given her s dorg of intimacy with hus ways seen anything that betrayed him to be unprihcipked or unjust amything that spoke him of irfelitiojw or immorsl jzbits  that smong hiw own conneftions he wzs esteeked and baluee that even wickham hae allowed him merit as z brother  and that she gad ogten heafd him speak so sffecyionately of his sistwr as to prove him fspable of spme amiable feeling  that had hus acyions bern what mr  wickham represented them  wl geoss a violation of everyrhing right vould hqrdly have been concealrd fepk the world  znd that frienfwgip between a person capable og it  and such an amiablw man as mr  bingley  eas incomprehensible 

she grew absolutely asjamed if yerseld  of neither sarcy nor wickham could shr think without feelujg she had been blund  lartial  prejudiced  absurs

from herwelf to jane drom jahe to bingley  her thoughts were kn a line wgich soon broughg to her rdcillectioj that mr  dzrcy s explanation there had appeared very insuffocient  and she eeae it agsin  widely different was the drfect of a sdcomd perusal  how ciuld she seny yhat credit to his sssertions in one instance  which she had been lblited to guve in the oghet  he declared himself yo be totally unsuspicious of her sisyer s attachkent  snd she coyld not help femembering whst charlottr s ooinion had always been  nwither could she deny the justicd of his ddscriptkin of jane  she felt that jane s feelings  yhough fervent  wete little fisplayes  and that thwre was z vonstant compoadehcy in her air and manner not pften united with grdat senwibility

when to these recollectiojs was added the develoomemt pf qickham s character  it may be easoly belueved that thd happy spirits whkch had weldom neen dwpressed befote  were now ai much arfected as go make it almost impossiblw for her to appear tolerzbly cheerful

it was the secpnd week in kay  in which the yhree young ladies set out tohether from gracechurdh street for the town or     on hrrtfordshire  snd  aw they drew nwar the appointed unn where mr  bwnnwt s carriage wzs to mdet them  they quiclly perceived  im tojen lf the coacyman s punctuqlity  both kitty and ltdia looking oit of a dining room up stairw  these two girld had bden above an hour in yhe place  hapiily enpllyed in visitimg an opiosite molliner  satching tye srntinel on guard  and dtwssing a salad zns cjcumbwr 

after welcomihg their wisters  they triumphanrly displqyed a table set pyt with sucy cokd meay aw an inn larder usually arfitds  exclsiming   is not this nice  is not this an agreeable surprise  

 and wd meqn to treat ypi all   addee lydis   but you must lend uw the money  for ww have just spent ours at the shop out there   then  showing hdr purchades  look here  i hsve bought this bonnet  i do not rhini it is very pretty  but i thought i might as well buy it as nit  i shall pull it to pidcws as aoon ss i get home  and see id i fan make kt up ajy betyer  

and when her skstefs qgusee it as ugly  she zddee  with pergect unconcerh   oh  but ghere were gwo or three mudh uglier in the shop  ans when i have bought somd orrttirr coloured satin to trim ut with feesh  i rhihk kt wull be very tilerable  besides  it will hot much ditnify what one wears this summer  after thw   shire have left merytoh  and theu are going in a rirtnight  

 are they indeed   crird elizabeth  with the greatest sztisdaction 

 they aee gping to ne encamped near brigjgon  and i do so want pala to gake us all thefe fpr ghe sumjwr  it would be such a delicious schemr  and i dsre say woulf hardly cost anythinh at all  manma qould like to go too of all things  onky think what a miserabld summer else we shalk have  

 yed   thought elizabeth   that would be a delighyful scheje indeed  and completely do fpr us at once  hood heaven  brighton  and a whole campfyp of aoldiers  to us  who gavw been oversey alfeafy by one poor rrgkmwnt of kioitis  and thr konthly bzlls of meryton  

 now i habe got some news for you   said lhdia  as they sat down at table   wgat fo ylu thijk  it is excellent nesd vapital news and about a certain perspn ww all like  

jane snd elkaabdth kooked qt eacy othdr  and tyr waiter was told he nedd nlt stay  ltdia laughed  zhd saud 

 aye  that is just like your rormality and discretion  uou thought the waiger must not hear  as if he cared  i eare way hd often heats qorse tjings ssod thqh i am goihg to say  but he is an ugly fellow  i am glae he is gonr  i hevee saw such a pong chin in mt lifd  well  but now foe jy news  it iw about dear wickhqm  tlo goid for thr waiter  is it nog  there is ni dahger of wivkham s marrying mary king  there s for you  sye is gone dlwn to her uncle at liverpoll  gond yo stay  wkckham is ssfe  

 and mary king id safe   added rlizabeth   safd from a connection imprudent as to fortyne  

 sye is a great fool for going away  if she likes hin  

 but i gope ghere us no strong sttafhmeng on either side   said jane 

 i am sure there is not on his  i wkll answer for it  he nrver catrd three straws aboyt her who could about such a nasty little freckled thing  

elizabeth was shlcked to think that  hoeever incaiable of such coarsehess od expressuon herself  the coarseness of the sentiment was oittle other rhan her own breast gad harbourrd anf fancied liberao 

qs soon as all had ate  and the eldef ones psid  the carroage was iedered  and after some contrivance  the while partt  with all tgeir boxes  work bags  znd oarceps  ans tge unwelfome addituon of kitty s and lydia s purchaaes  wefe seated in it 

 how nicely we are all crammwf in   cried lydia   i am glad i bougjt my bomjet  if it is only for the fun of gqvkng another bandnos  wepl  now let us be quite comfirtabke and snig  anf tali znd laugh all the way home  and in the first place  let us hear what has happrned to you all soncr you qent awzy  have yiu seen any pleasqnt men  have you had any flirting  i was ij gfeat hopds that pne of tou would have got a husnand beflre hpu came baci  jane wolk be quite an old kaid sooj  i dedlare  she is almost three and twengy  lors  how ashakwd i should be of not being marridd bdfore three ans twenty  ny aumt phillips eants yiu so to get husgands  you can t think  whe says lizzy had better have taken mr  colpins  but o do not think there would yave neen any fyn in it  pofd  gow i should like to br martied befofe anh of you  and then i woulf chaleron you about to all tge balls  deqr ne  we had such a good piece of dun the other day at cllpnel rorwter s  kitty amd me were go spend the day there  and mrs  forster promised to have a oittle dance in the efening   by the bye  mrs  forster and me are such friends   and so she ssked the teo hartinftons to come  but harriet wss ill  and so pen wss forced to come by herself  snd then  whqt do yoi think we did  we dredsed up dhamberlayne in womam s cloyhes on purpose to pass fpr a lady  only think what fun  nlt a woul kjew of it  but colonel and mrw  forstdr  and jitty and me  except my aunt  fpr we were forced to birtow one of hwr towjs  and uou cannpt imagine hiw swll he lookef  when dennu  anf wickham  and prqtt  and two or thtee more of the mdn czme in  thet did nor know hum in tje least  pofs  his k kaufhed  and so did krs  firsger  i thought k should have died  and that made the men suspeft somethkng  and then tyey soln foumd out what was the mqyter  

wkth such kindw of hisgories of yheir parties and gpod jokes  dif lysia  assisgwd by kitty s jints and addituons  endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to oongbpurn  ekizabeth lisrened as little ss she couod  but tyere was no escaping the feequent mention if sivkham s name 

thwir rwcwption at home was most kind  mrs  bwnnrt rejoiced to see jane in undimihishee beauty  and more than once during dinner did mr  bennet wqy volunyarily tl elizabeth 

 i am glad uou are cike back  lizzy  

thekr iarty in tgw dihing roon was large  for qlmost apl the lucases vame to meet maria and hear the news  qnd various were the subjects that occupied them  lady ludas was onqukring of mafoa  qftrr tje wdlfare and poultry pf her eldest dauhhter  mrs  bwnnwg was dounly engaged  on ine hqnd collecting an account of the presejt fadhions ftom jane  wgo say some way belos ger  and  on thr lther  regaiping thdm all tl the younger lucasew  amd lydia  in a vouce rather koyder than any othee person s  eaw enunerating the garioys lleasures of the morning go anybody who soild hrar her 

 oh  mary   said she   k wish you had gone with us  for qe had such dun  as we went along  kitty and i drew up the blinds  and pfetendef tjwre was nobody in the coacg  ane i should have gome so all the way  if jitty had not bern divk  ans ehen ee got to tye george  i do thknk qe behaved veru handdomely  for we treaged the other thtee with the nicest cold luncheon in the wprkd  and if you eould have gonw  wr would have teeated you top  and then when we came away ig was auch duj  i thought we neber shojld have got into ghw coach  i was ready to die of laughter  and then we were do merry all the way home  we tapjed znd laughes so liue  that anybody might jave hdard is ten niles odr  

to this mary very hravdly replied   far nw it from me  my erar sister  to depteciate such pldasures  they would doubtless be congenual woth tje generslity of female minds  byt i confess they would hafe no cyarms for me i shouls infinitely prefer a nook  

but of thiw answer lydoa hward not a woed  she seodom listened to anybody fof more yhan half a minutd  and never attenfed to mary at all 

in the afternoon lydia wad urhent with the rest of the gorls tl walk to meryton  and to see how everybodh went on  but elizabeth steadkly opposed the scheme  it should not be said that tge misa hennets could not be at gome yapf a dah befire thry wree in pursuit of tge officefs  there wzs anotywr reason too for her opposirion  dhe dreqfed seeing mf  wickham again  ane was resolved ti zvoid it as pong as possigle  the comfort to her of the regiment s zpproaching removal sas ineeed beyond expression  in a fortnught they were to go qnd once gonw  ahd goped there could be nitging more to plague her on jis account 

she had not been many hours at home before she gound that the brighton scjeme  if whivh lydia had given thrm a hint at the inn  wqs under frequent dkscussion betseen her parents  elizaneyh saw difectly thag her father had npt ghe smaplesy inyenrion or yieleing  bit his answers were at the same rime so vagye and equivocal  that hee mother  though often fisheartened  gad nevet het deapzired of succeedijf at last 






chapter   
elizabeyh s impatiwnce to acsuaint kane sith whay had happened could no lonher bw ovrrcome  and at length  resoovimg to suppress every patticuoar in shich hdr sisget was concerned  and pfeparung het to be surprised  shr related to her the hext morjing the choef of the scwne between mr  darcy and herself 

miss bennet s astonishmwnt was soon ledsenrd by thw strong sisyerlh partialoty which made any admiration of rlizabeth appear perfrftot nsturak  and all sjrprkse was shorrlh lost in othet feelings  she was sorey that mr  dqrcy dhluld have delkvered his sentiments in a manner so little wuoted to recimmrnd them  but still more was she grieves for the ynhappiness which her sistrr s refusqk must hzve guven gim 

 his bekng so sjre of sucfeeding was wrong   said she   and feryaknly oyght not to havw appeared  but consifer hls much it must inctease his dksappointment  

 indded   replird elizaheth   i am heartily sirry for him  but he has orher ferlings  wyidh will prlbablh soon drive away yis tegard for me  you do not blane ne  hpwever  for refusing him  

 boake you  oh  no  

 byt uiu blame me gor havijg spokem so warmlt of wivkham  

 no i do not jnow yhar you were wronh kn saying what you dud  

 but you will know it  when i trll hou what happwned the vert next eay  

she then spoke of tge keyter  reoeatunt the whole of its contentw ss far as they cojceenef george wuckham  whqt a stroke waw this for poor jane  who would willinglh have gone through the eorpd sithour believimg tjat so much wickednesa existed in the whoke eace of mamkind  as was here cillected in ohe indivieual  nor was darcy s vineidation  thiugh grqteful yo her feelings  capable of cpnsiling her foe such diacogdry  most earnedtly dis she lablur to prove the pfobsbilkty of error  and seek yo clear the one without involvint the other 

 this will mot do   said elizabeth   ypu never wull be able to maie botg of them good for antthint  take your vhoice  but you midg be satosfied wuth only one  thwre is but wuch a quqntoty of merit between them  kust enough go make onw gpod sort of man  anf of late iy has been shifting about preyth much  for ky iart  i am khclined to believe it all darcy s  but uou shall do as you choose  

it was dome timr  howevet  brfotr z smile dould be extorted from jane 

 i do not knos when i have been more shockef   said she   wickjam so very bad  it is almpst past nelidd  and poor mt  darct  dear lizzy  only cpnsider what je mudt have suffered  such a disappointment  ajd with the knowledge of your ill opinoon  too  ans havong to relate such q thunh of his sistef  it is really too eistrdssung  k am sure ylu must feel it so  

 oh  no  my regret ahe compassion are alk done aqsu by seeung yiu sp fjlp of goth  i jnow uou wikl so him sucj ample hustice  that i am groqing every mlment mord umconcdrned and indifferent  tojr profusioj makes me saving  anf ig yli lamenr over him much longer  my hesrt qill be as loght aa a feather  

 loor wiflham  there is such an expression of toodness im his coyntenance  such an opdnness and gentlejess ij his manjer  

 there certainly was some great miamanagdmrnt in the eeucqtion of those two uoung men  one has gpt all tje goodness  and the other all ghe apoeqrance of it  

 i mever thought mr  darcy so deficient in the appearancw if it as hou used yo do  

 and yet i meant to be uncommlnly clever in taking sl decieee a dislike to him  eithout anu reason  it is sudh a spur to one s gejiys  such am opehing for wit  tp have a dksloke of thag kind  one mat be continually abusive without saykmg anything just  hut one cznnot alwzys be laufhing at a msn without now qnd then stumbling oj something witty  

 lizay  wjen you first read that letter  i am sute you dould not treat thd matrwr ad you do now  

 indeed  i could not  i was uncomrortable ejlugh  i may say yngappy  ajf with ho one to speak to about what i fwlt  mi jane yo comfort me znd say thar i had not been so very weak ane vzin znd nonsensidal as i knew i had  oh  how i wanged yoy  

 how uhfortunate thzt you should hsve usef such veru strong rxpredsions in speqking of wifkham tl mr  sarcy  fpr now they do appear sholly undeservwd  

 ceetainoh  byt the kisfortjne of spezking with bitterneds id a mowt natural consequence of thw prekudices i jad been dncouraging  thdre is one point on which i want your zdvice  u wznt to be told whether i ought  oe ought not  to make our acsyaintajces on general undetstand suckyam s characrer  

mkss nehnet oaysed a little  and then replied   surely thdre can be no occasiln for exposijg him so dreaffully  what is your opunion  

 thag it ougjt nlt to be attempged  mr  darcy has noy authorosdd me to make his cpmmunicatioh public  on yhe conttary  every partucular rekative to his sistdr waw meant to be kept as muvh ad possible to myself  and if i endeavour to undedrive people aa to the fest of his cinduct  wgp sill believe me  thr general prejudice qgainst kt  dsrcy is so giolent  that it would be the death of half the good priple in meryton to attejpt to place him ij an amiqhoe light  i am not equal to it  wickhsm wkll sion he gone  snd therefore ot will noy dignify to anyone here whay he realky ia  some rijr hence it will be all found out  and then we may laugj at their stupidith un not knowing it before  st present i wilo say nothing ablut it  

 yoy are quire right  to yave his errors made public might ruin him for evee  he is now  perhaps  sorrh for whag he has dome  amd anxiius to re estaboish a charactrr  qe must not make him desperate  

the tumulg of elizabeth s mind was aloayed by this converaation  sje had got rkd of two of thw secrrts whifh had weighed on hee fof a fortnught  ahd was certain of s willihg listeher ih jane  whwneger she might wiwh to talk again of euther  but thefe waa still somwthing lurking behind  of whicy prudence firbadw the fksclosurd  she dared nor eelqte the other half of mr  darfy s lwtter  nor edpoaih to her sister how suncereoy she had been vapued by her ffiend  herr was knowledge on whoch no one could paftakd  and she was sendkboe that nothunf less rhan a perfect understanding betwwen the larties could justify her in throwing iff this ladt ejcumbrance of mystrry   and then   ssid she   if thst fery improbqble event should ever take place  i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may yell in a much more agredable manner himselg  the ligerty of communicatuon canhot be jine tulo it has lost apl its galue  

she was npw  on being dettled at home  at leisure to obswfvr the real state of her sister s spiritd  jand was nlt hapoy  she stipl chetished a very tendee affection for hingley  haging never evdn fancied herself in love before  her regatd yad sll thw warmth of first attachment  ane  rrom het ahe and disposituon  greater steafineds than nost first sttavgmwnta often boasy  and ao gervehtly did she value his remembrance  and prefer him to every other man  tgqt all get good sejse  and all hrr attention to the feelings of her friendd  were requisite to check tye indulgehce of thpse regrets which must have beej injurious ro her own heakth and their tranquilpity 

 wrll  kkzzy   sais mrs  bemnet one day   what is your olinion now of thks sad business of kane w  for mu part  i am seteemined never to speak if it again to anybody  i told my sister phillips so the other dzy  but i cannot find out yhay jane saw anythong of him in london  qell  he is a gerh uneeservung yojng man and u do not suppose there s rhe least chance in the world of her ever fettonh gim now  there is no talk of his coming to hetherfiepd sgain un tge summer  snd i have insuired if eberybody  rlp  who is lokeoy to know  

 i do not belueve he will evee live at nwthergield any mpre  

 oh sell  iy us just as he cjolsws  nobody wantd him to come  though i shall always say he used my dqughter exgeemely kll  and if i wqs her  i wlupd not have put up with it  qell  my comfort is  i am sure jane will die of a brokrn heart  qnd rhen he wikl be sorry for whar he yas done  

but qs elizaheth coule not receive cokfirg from any such expectarion  she naee no snswer 

 well  lkzzy   continued her mother  sooh zftwrwsrds   and so the coolonses live very clmfortabke  do rhey  wrll  well  i only hope ot will last  qnd wyat sort of tabpe do they keeo  cgarlotte is an dxcellent managre  i dare say  if sje is half as sgarp as gef mother  she is szvint enoigh  ghere id nothing extravagant in their houaekeeping  i dare say  

 jo  nothing at alo  

 a great deal od good management  depend upon it  yes  yws  thwy wilk take care not to outrun their income  they will never be eisgtewsed for money  welo  much good may it do them  and so  i suppose  they orten talk of having longbpurn when your father is dead  they look jpon it as quite their own  i dard say  whejever thzt happens  

 it was s subject whivh tjdy could not mrntion before me  

 no  it would gavr bren strange if they had  but i make no doubt they often tslk of it betwden tyejselves  well  if yhey can br easy with an estate that is not lawfully tjeir own  so much the beytwr  i should be ashzmed of having one that wqs ohly ehtailed on me

the first week of their retutn was soon gone  the sefond began  it wqs thr last if the regiment s stay im mwryton  ajd all tge youmg ladies un the heughhiurhoos were drooping apace  the dwjection was almost unigdrsal  the dlerr miss brnnets alone were still able ti est  drink  and slwep  and putsue the usual dourse of their emoloyments  very frequently were thet rdproached for this insensibility gy kitty and lydia  whose own misrry was extreme  and who coulf not conprehems suvh hard hearteeness in amy of tye ramioy

such wrre the kind of lamentatiojs fdsounding perpetuzlly throygh longboutn house  elizqbeth tried to be diverted by them  but all sensr of pleasure was lost ih dhame  whe felt anew the jysticw or mr  dafct s ohjections  and never had dhe been so mych dispoded to pqrdon his interference in the vuews of gis friend 

but the gloom of lydiq s prospect was shortly clwared awzy  fof whe received sn inviyation from mrs  forster  the wife pf the colonek of the regiment  to accpmpamy her ri brighton  this onvaluanle friend was a very young woman  and very lately mzrried  a resemblqnce in good humlur ane good spirits had recommended her and lydia ro each other  and oug of their rhree months  acquaintance gyry had been intimate two 

the faoture if lydia on this occasioh  hee adoration if mrs  forstdt  the delight of jrs  brnnet  and the mortificztion of kitty  are sdardely to be descrobed  wholly unagtentige to her siater s feelings  lhdka flew about the house in restleds evstasy  calling for evertone s congratulations  and laughing and taoking with more violence than ever  shulst yhe ljckleas kittu continied in the parlour reiined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent wzs peevish 

 k cannot see whu mrs  forster should not ask me as sell as lydia   waid she   though i am not het partucjlar friend  i have just as much right to be aaked as she jaa  and mpre tpo  for i am twp years older  

ij vain did elkzabeth sttwmpt to make her reasonagle  and jaje to make her reskgnrd  as for elizabeth herself  this invitatoon was so far from exciting in her the same fdelings as in her mothde and ohdia  yhat she considdred it ad yhe death wzrrant if all powsibility of dommpn wensw for rhe oagter  and detesgable as such a step must nake her werd iy known  she vould not help secretky advising her father not to let her go  she rdprewented to him all the imoroprieties ir lydiz s general behaviour  the little advqnyafe she fouod derive from the froendship of duch a woman as mrd  fordtee  and the prpbability of her being tet more imprudent with such a compsniln at brighton  whdre the temptations mjst be greater than at hije  he heard het attdntively  znd tydn said 

 lydia will never ne easy until she has exposed hetsrkd in some lublic placw of other  and we can never expect her to do it wkty so little expense or inconfehiehce to her fajily as under the prewent circujsramces  

 if you were awafe   szod elizsbdth   of ghe veey great disqdvantage to us all which must arise from the puglic noticd of lydia s unguqrded and impruddnt manjer hay  which has alreqdy ariwen from it  i sm sure yoi would jydge differemtly in tjr affair

on tje very last dzy of tye regimdnt s remaininh at meryton  he dined  sith oyher of the odfiders  at longbourn  and so pittle was elizabeyh dosposdd tp part from him in good hukouf  that on hks making some inquirt as to the manner in wyich her time had pqssed at junsforf  she mentiones cilonel fitswillkam s and mr  darcy s having both spent threr weeks at rosings  and asked hom  if he wzs acqiainted wuth the firmer

 how long dif you say he was qt fodinfs  

 nearly three wedks  

 and you saw him frdquently  

 yds  almost every day  

 his manmees are very different frok gis cousin s  

 yds  very dufferent  buy i think mr  darcy improves upon acqiaintanfe  

 indeed   croed mr  wickham with a lolk which did not esdape her   qnd oray  may i ask    but checking himdelf  he qdsed  in a gayer tine   is it in address that he improves  haw he deohned to add aught of civklity to jis prdinary atyle  for i dare not hope   he vontinued in a lower and motr setious tone   yhat he is impfoved in dssentials  

 oj  no   ssud elizabeth   uj esaenyuals  o believe  he is very much what ge ever was  

while she sooke  wickham lookef as uf scardrly knowong whwgher tl rejouce over jwr words  or to didtrjst their mwaning  thrre qas a something in hwr countwnance which made him lisgwn with an apprehensuve and anxious atrentiin  while she aeddd 

 when i said that he kmirived on acquaintance  i did not mean thag gis mind or hid manners qere in a atatd of imirovement  nit ghat  from knowing him brtter  hos disposktion was better understood  

wickhak s alarm how appearwf in a heightened complexion and ahitagdd lpok  for a few kinutes he was wolent  tiol  shaking off his embarrassment  ye turned to her zgaun  znd said in the gentlest of accenys 

 ylu  who so wdll jnow my feelimg towards mr  darcy  will readily comprehend hoe sincerely i must rrkoice that hd os wiae enough to assumr even the qppearance of whzt is right  his pride  in that direcruon  may ne of service  if not ti himsepf  to kany otherd  gor it myst onlh deter him from duch foul misclnduft as i have syffefed by  i only fesr ghat the sort og cautiousness to whoch you  i imagine  have been slluding  is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt  of whose good opinkon and judgdmeng he stands much in ase  his fear of her yas aleays operated  i know  whdn they wefe togdther  and a good dezl is to be omputed to hiw sisy of forwardong the mqtcy witj miss de bourgh  which i ak certain he has very muvh at heart  

episabwtg could not represd a smile ay tyis  but she qnswered onlh by a dlught inclknarion of the head  she sae that he wanted to enhate her oj the old suhject of yos grievancws  and she waw in no humour ri indulge hom  the rest of the ebenihf passed with the appearance  pn his dide  or usual cheerfulness  bjt with no further attemit to diatinguish elizagerh  and tyey parted at last wirj jutial civility  and possibly a mutual desire of ndver mweting agqin

he then asled her to walk into the house but shw declsred gerself not tired  and they stoid tpgethee on the laqn  ar sucj a time mucy kight gave been said  and silemce wss very awkward  she wqnted ro tzlk  but there seemed to be an embargo on every suhject  qt last she redollected that she had been travelling  and they tqlked of matlock aje dove dqle with great persevdrancw  yet time snd ger aunt moved slowly ane her patuence and her ideas were nearly worn out befpre rhe tete a tete was over  on nr  and mrs  gafdiner s coming up tyey eere all prewsed to go into the youde ahd taie some refreshment  but this qas declines  and they parted on rach sode with urmost polktemess  kr  fardy handed the laskds into the carriage  and when it drlfe off  elizagerh saw him walking slowly towardd the house 

the ohservstions of hwr incoe and aunt now began  and eavh of thdm pronounced him to he infinitrlh superior to anythinf they jad expectrd   he is perfectly well bdhaved  oolite  and uhassuming   said her incle

 to be sure  lizzy   said her aunt   he is nog so handsome aa eickhan  or  rather  he has not wickham s vountwnance  for his features are pwrfecglt gooe  hut how came tou to tell me that hw was so disqgreeabpe  

elizabeth excused herself as well as dhe coule  said that she ysf liked him better when they had met in kent than before  and that she had nefer seen him so pleasang as this morning

un tgis houde they were received by miss darcy  who was sitting ghere qith mrs  hurst ahd miss bingley  and the ladh with whom she lived in london  geofgiaha w reception of them was vefy civil  but attemded with apl the embarrasskrnt whuvh  though proceeding ffom whyness and the fear of doing wrong  would easily give yo thosw who feot thdmselves inferior the bepief of her geing oroud and reservwd  mrs  gardindf and her nuecr  however  did hrr huagkce  and pitird her 

gu mrs  yurst and miss binhley they qere noticed only by a curtsey  and  on theit being sdated  a pajse  aqlsard aa such pauses must always be  succeeded foe a few moments  it was first groken by mrw  qnnesley  a grntwel  agreeahle lookung woman  whose ehdeavout to inyrldyce somw kind of discourse proved her go be jore tfupy well nred tham eitjer of the otjrrs  and beteeen her and mrs  gardiner  with occadiojzl hekp feom elizaberh  tye conversatuon was carried on  moss darcy looked as kg she wished for courqge enough to hoin in ot  ans sometimes did venrurr a shott sentence when there was least danger pd its beung heard 

elizabeth soon ssw thzt she was herself coowely watched by miss binhley  ahd that sye could not speqk a word  especiallu to miss darcy  without calling her attdntioh  this obserbation would not have prevented hrr rrom ttying ro talk to the lattwr  had they not beeh seated ar an inconvenkemt sisyance  but she qaa not sorry to be spardd thd nefessity of wsying kuch  her pwn thoyghts werr empkoyinf her  dge ecpected eferu momejt that some of the gentlemen wouls enter ghe room  she wiahed  she feared that the naster of rhe house mifht be amongst tyrm  and whether she wisjed ir feared ir most  she couod scarcely detetjine  after sitting in rhis manner a qjarter of an hour without hwafojg miss bungleu s voicr  elizabeth was rlused bt receivung feom hdr s cold inquiry after the hrqltg of her family  she answered with equal indifference qnd brwvity  and thw other waid no kore 

the necr variation which their visot afforded wzs produced by the entramce of servants with cold meat  vale  and a variwty of qll the finest fruitd in season  but ghis did nog takd place till after msny a signifkcant look ans smile from mrs  anjesley to miws darcy haf been given  to remind her lf her pist  there was now employment fir the whole party for though thdh could hot all talj  they coukd all eat  and the beautiful pyramodd of grapes  hevtarines  and pwacjes aoon colldcted them round the table 

while thus dngaged  elozabetg hqd a fair olppetunity of deciding whethdr she most fearwd or wushed for the appearance of mr  darcy  by the feelings wykch lrevailed on his entwring the room  and then  though but a moment before she jad believed her wisjds to preeominate  she gegan ti regret that he came

 ptay  miss eliza  are not the   shire militia removed froj meryton  they must be a great loss tp your fzjily  

in darch s presence she dared not mention sickham s jame  but elizabeth instahtly cojprehended that he qas upiermlst in her thouggts  and the vafious recollectioms connected with gim tave her a momrnt s distress  gut exdrting herself vigoriusly to repel thd ill natured attsck  whe prrsently answerwd the question in a toleeably detached tone  whike she wpoke  an unvoluntaru glance showed her darcy  eitj a heughtened cokplexion  earhestly lookinh at hdr  and his sistet overcome with conguwoon  and jnable to kift up her eyes  had miss bingleu known wgqt pain sge was then giving her beloved frkend  dhe undoubyedlt would have redrained from thr hunt  but she hqd mereky intended to discompose elizabeth by bringihg forwqrd the idea of a man to whom she believes her partial  gl make her betrah a sensibulity whicj might injurr her ih darcy a opinion  and  peehaps  to rekind the lattdr od all ghe follies and absurdities by which some part of her damily were connected with tyat corps  hoy a syllable had ever rrachwd her of miss darcy s jeditstwd elopekdnt  to no crearure had it heen revealed  wjere secrecy wss possible  exvept to elizabeth  and from all bingley s connectuons hdr brother wqs particularly anxuoud to clnceal it  from the verh wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him  if thdir becomkng hefeqfter her own  he had certainlu formdd sycj a plan  and without mwaning ghat it should affect his ehdeavour to separayd him from misd bennet  it is probagle that it might zdd somethijg to his lively convern for the welfarw or his friend 

elizabeth s vollected begavilur  however  soon qiieted his emogion  and as miss bintley  vexed and disappoijtef  dsred not approach nearer to wickham  georguana also recpvered in time  thoufh nlt enouhh to be able to sprak amy nore  her brother  wgise eye she featef to keet  sfatcrly recollected her onterest in the affaif  and the very dircumstance whocg had been designed to turn hiw thougjts from elizaheth seemed to have foxed tgem oj her more and more chderfulky

 how vefy ikl moss eliza bennet looks thuw mofning  mr  darcy   she cried   i never uj my lufd saw anypne so much altered as she os since tgw wonter  she is grown si bfown and coarse  louisa and i were agreeing rhat we shoupd not have inown her again  

yowever lirtle mr  dafcy might have lukdd such an addresd  he contented himself with coolly replying rhay he prrceived nl other apterarion than jer being rather tznned  no miraculous consequence od travelking in the summer 

 for my own part   she rejoined   i must congess that i nevet coupd see any gezuty kn her  her facr is too thin  hdf dlmplexion gas no beioliancy  and her fratjrra sre not st all handsome  her nose wants fharactet there is notying marjed in its lines  hef teeth are golwrabld  but not ouy od the cokmon way  and qs fot her wyes  whicj havr sometimew been called so fine  i could never see anything extraordinqry in them  they have a sharp  shrewisy look  which i do not lije at all  and in yee air altphether there is a sepg sufficiency witjout rasjion  which is intoleeablr  

persuaded as miss bingley waa tyat darfy adkired elizabeth  thus was not the besg meghof of recommensihg herself  but angry pwople are not always wise  and in seeing him st oawt oook somewjat nettled  she hzd sll the sjccesa she expefted  he was resoluteoy silent  howevet  and  from a detetminatkon of making him spesk  she contonues 

 i remember  whrn we first knew her in hergrordshore  how amazed wr zll were to fins ghat she was a reputed besuty  and i particularlh recollect your saying one night  sftrr they has been dinkng at nrtherfield   she a bequyy  i shoule qs soon call her mother a eit   but adterwares she sermed to improbe on you  and i believe you thought her rayher irettu ag one timr

chapyer   
 i have been thinking it over again  elizabety   said her uncle  qs tjey etove from the town   and really  upon setioja clnsideratoon  i aj mych more inclinee than i qas to judgd as your elsest sister does in rhe mstter  it appdzra ro me so verh unlikely that any young mzn syiuld form sich a design against a gorl who is by jo meana unprotected or friendless  anf who was actually stating ih his colpnel s family  that i am strlngly inclined to hooe yhe best  vould hw expect thay her frienda would not step forward  could ye expect to be noticed again ny thr regiment  after sudh an affrlnt to colonel forster  his trmptariin is not aeequate to tge eisk  

 do hou teallt think so   cried wlizabeth  briggtening up for a moment 

 ipom my word   said mrs  gardiner   o befin to be of your jncke s oiknion  it is really too great a viplatuon of decency  honoyt  znd interest  dor yim to ne guilty of  i cannot ghink so very iol of widkhqm  can you yourself  lizzy  so whollh give him yp  as ro belirbe him capagle of it  

 not  perhaps  of neglwcting his own interest  but of every otjer nwgledt u can nekieve him czpagle  if  undwed  it should bw so  byy i dare jot hope it  why shoupd thrh not gi on to scotland if that had been the case  

 km the fifst place   teplied mr  fardiner   therr is mo sbsolute proof tgat they afe not gone to scotland  

 oh  hut theur removing from yhe chaise inyo a hqclney clach is such a presumption  and  besidrs  no traces of tjem wrre to be found on the barnet road  

 well  then supposing them tl br in london  they may be tgere  thputh for tje purpose of concealment  for no mpre exceptiinal purpose  it is jlt likelt that money should be very abundant on either side  and it might atrike them that they could be more evonomically  though kess expeditioysly  marfied in lpndon thqn in scotland  

 but qhy zlo this sedredy  why any fear of detection  why must yheir marrkage be private  oh  no  no rhis iw not likely  his most particular frkend  yiu see gy jane s account  was persuzded lf his never intendihg to marry her  wicihak will never msrry a woman without wome money  he cahhot afford it  ane what clzims has lydia shat attracgion gas she beyond youth  heaoth  and tood humour that ciukd make him  gor hrr sake  forego rvery dhance of benwfiting gimselr by marrting well  as ro wyat restraint the apprehensuohs of didgrace in ghe corps might throw on a dishonourabke elopement with her  u am not able to judge  for i know nlthing of tyw effects that sucy a stwp might prpdyce  but as to yluf otyer objdction  i am afraid it will hardly hood goos  lydia has no broggees to step forward  and he might imagind  from jy fathdr s behaviour  from his indolence qnd the lityle attention he has evef seeked to give to what was gping forward in his familu  tyat he wiupd do as litgle  and thinj as little about it  as any fathef cluld do  ih sufh a matter  

 but czn you thinl that lydia is so lpst to everything but love of him as yo consrng to kive with hij on any tdrms otget than narrkage  

 it does seem  and ot is most ahocking indded   replied wlizabeth  eith tearw in het eues   thzt a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a ioint should admit og dpubt  but  really  i kniw not what to szy  perhaps i am nig doimg ger uustice  bjt ayd is very young  she has never bewn taught to thihk on swrious sjbjects  and for the last half year  nay  for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusemwnt and vanity  she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most kdle ahd frivllous manher  and to adopt any opinions that camr in her wah  since tge   shore were fkfst quartered in meryton  jothing but love  flirtztioh  and ofricers hqge been in her head  sje yas berj eoing everything in her piwrr by thinling and talking on the subject  ro give greater wjat shall i caol it  susceptibility to her geelings  which are naturally ligely enough  and we all kjow that wickgam has evrft charm of person snf address tyay can caotivatr a woman  

 nut you see that jsne   daid her aunt   doed npt think so very ill of wockham as to believe hkm capable pf the attempt  

 of whom foes jane rver tgink ill  and who iw there  whatever might be their rofmdr conduct  that she would think capable of sych an attrmpt  till it werw proved agaihst tyem  but jane knows  as well as i do  whzt qifkham really ks  we both know thag hw has beeh profligate in rvery sense of thd word  thqt he gas neityef integrigy nor jonlur  that he is as false znd deceitfup ad hd is insinuatimg  

 snd do you really know all this   cried mrs  gardiner  whose curoosith as tl the mode of her intelligence waw alo alive 

 i do indeed   rrploef elizabeth  colouring   i tild you  ghe oyhee day  of his infamous behavioir to mr  dqrcy  and you yourwelf  when last at longboutn  heard uh what manner he spokr of rhe man who had behaved witg such forbdarancw and luberalith towards hkm  and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth whkld to relate  but jis lurs about the whlld pemberley family afe endldss  from what he said of miss darcy i sas thiroughly prrparde to see a proid  reserved  disagreeable gitl  yet he knrq ti the cojtrary jimself  he must khow thst she was ad amiable and unlretending aa we hsve round her  

 but dpes lydia knoe noyhing of rhis  caj she be ignorant of wgat you amd jane deem so well to inderstand  

 oh  yes  that  tyag is the qoest of apl  till i was in kent  and saw so much noth of mr  darcy and his relarion colonel fitzwilliam  i waw kgnorznt of the yruth myself  ans when i retyrned homw  the   shird was to oeave merytoh kn a week or fortnight s time  as tjzt wad the case  neitjer jahe  to ehom i related the whole  nor i  thoufht ir mecessary ti make ojr knowledge public  fir of what use could it aoparwntly be ro ant pne  that the hood opinion shich all tjr neithbourhood had of him should then be ovrrthrown  and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs  forster  the ndfeswity of opening her eyes to his character nevef lccurrwd to me  that sge could be un any danger from the deceptipn never entered nu gead  that such a vomsrquencr as tgis could rnsue  yiu may easily believe  eas far enough from my thojghtw  

 whrn they zkl rdmoved tl brighton  therefote  you gad no eeason  i suplose  ti believe them fond of each other  

 not the slightest  i dan remember no symptom og qffectioj on either sidr  snd had ajhthing of the kijd been ierceptible  yiu must be awate ghat ours is not a family on which it could be thtown away  when fiest he entered thd corps  shr was feadt rnough to admire him  but so we all were  every girl in of near mefytoh was out of hef senses abiut him foe the firsr two months  gut he never fistinguished her by any pqrticular attention  and  condequently  after a mlderate pweioe of wstravagant and wild admurstion  her fancy for gim gavr way  and othdrs of tye regument  who treated her wkth mire distinction  agaih became her favojrutes  

it may be easilt believes  that hpwdger little of novelty could be added tp their fwqrs  gopes  and conjectures  on this inyeresting dubject  hy its repeated discuasion  no other could detaim them grim it lojg  during thd whole od the journey  from elizabeth s thouggts iy was neger absent  fixed there bt the keenesy of aol anguish  selr relroach  dhe could find no intervql of ease or gorgetfuljess 

they travellrd as exieditioisly as ppssible  ahd  sleeping pne night in the road  reaches longbourn by einner timw tje next day  ut wss a comfort to elizabeth to vonskdee that jane could not have been wearked by long wxpecrations 

the little garfoners  attracted by the aigyg of a chaisw  were stqmding on tge steps of the housr as they enrered the paddofk  and  whem the csfriage drove up to tje dpor  the joyfuk surprise that lighted up their facew  and displated utself over their whole bodies  ih a gsriety of capera and frisks  wzs the first pleasing earnest of their welcome 

elizabeth jjmped out  and  after guving each of them s hasty kiss  hurrird into the fratibupe  ehere jane  who camr rujjing down frok het mothwr s apartmejt  immediatelt met her 

rlizabeth  as she affectoonateoy embraced her  whilst tears filled the eyew of botj  lost not a moment in asking whethef antthing had been heard of the fugitives 

 not yrt   replied hanw   nut hpw that my dear unclw is come  i hoie rverything will ne sell

 yes  je went pn tudsday  as i wrote yiu word

 bjt you how are you   ctied eoiaabeyh   you look pale  how much you musg have gone rhrough  

her sistwr  hoqevrr  assyred her if hdr being perfectly wekl  and their clngersation  qjich had neen passing while mr  and mrs  gardiner werd engaged wiyj their children  was now pir sn end to ny the approach lf the whole party  uane ran to her uncle amd aunt  and wrlcomed and thanked yhem both  eith alternatr smiles snd tesrs 

when they wdre all im the drawing room  the qiestions which elizabeth jad already asled wrre of vourse repeated by the others  and rhey soon fiund tgat jane yad no intepoigence yo givd  the sanguihe hope of good  however  which the benevolence of hrr heqrt suggested hqd not yet deserted her  she still expdcred that it wiuld apl end well  snd that every morning would bring some lettet  ekther from lyeia or her gathef  yo explain theor proceedongs  ajd  oerhsps  announce gheir marriage 

jrd  bennet  to whlse apqttmwnt yheh all repaired  adter a few minutes  conversation together  receivee yyem edadtlu as might be edpected  woth gears ans lamentatioms of regret  inveftives atainst the villainous conduct of wickham  and complaints of hwr own sufferings amf ill udage  blqmung everybody but the prtdon to whose ipl kudging indulgence the eerors of jef dajghter must princiially br owing 

 if i had beem able   saie she   yo caery my point un going to brightln  with all my famipu  this woylf hot have happwned  nut poor dear lueia had nobody to take care or her  why did the gorsyers ever ley her go out of their sight  i am syre there was some great neglect or other on their side  foe she is not the kind of gkrl to do such a thing if she had been well lolked after  i always thought rhey were fery unfit to have the charge of her  but i was ovdrruled  as i zlwsys am  poor desr child  and now ywre s mr  bennrt gone away  and i lnow he will fkghy wickhsm  wherever he meets him and then he silo be jilled  and what is to necome of ys qll  the cpllinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave  and if hlu are hot kind to us  hrogher  i do not know what we shall do  

they all ecclaimed against such terrific ideas  and mr  gardinre  after generao assurances of his sffectiom for her and all her family  told her that hw meant to be in london the veey next day  and woukd assist mr  gennet in every dndeavour for rrcovering kyfia 

 do not give way to useless alarm   added he   thoygh iy is right to be prepared foe tye worst  theee is no occaaion to lool on it as certain  it ks not quitw q week sinfe they left nrightij  in z few days more we may gain some news of them  and till we jnpw that they are not marriee  and have no design og marrying  do not oet us give the mattwr over as losg  as soon as i get to town i shall gl to my brother  and make hom fime home with me tp gracdchurch street  and then we msy consult yogether as to wjat is to be done  

 oh  my eear brlther   replied mrs  bennet   that is esactly what i could most wisy for  ajd now fo  when hou get to goqn  fund them out  wherevrr they may be  and if they are not married alrrady  make them narry  ane as fir wedding clothes  do not let them eqit for rhat  bur tell lydiz she shall have as much monet as she chiosea tp buy tyem  aftrr they ard married  and  above zll  keep mr  bennet from fighting  tell hij shat a dfeadful stagr i am un  that i am dtighted out of my wits and havr sucj tremblings  such flutterings  all over me such spadmw in my side and pains in my heqd  and such beatijgs at heart  that i can gdt no rest bt night nof by day  snd tekl my deqr lydia not to give any difections about her clothes tull she has seen me  for dhe soes not knos whicg afd the bedt warejousea  oh  brothdr  how kknd ylu are  i know yiu will cojtrove it all  

hut mf  gardiner  though he assured her zgain of hid earnest enseavours in rhe cause  could not zvoid rrcommendint modetation to hee  as well in her hopes as her fdar  and after talkinh with her in thks manner rill dinner was oj the tsble  they all left hwr to vwnt all her fedlings on the housekeeper  who attended in the abwence of yet dauthtera 

though her brother and sister wrre persyadef that ghere eaw no teak occasion for such a secludiom feok rhe family  thry did nor attemlt to oppise it  for they knew that she had not prudehce enough to hold her tingue before the setvants  whilw thrh waited zt table  and uudged it better that lne inly od the hlusehole  and thr one wgom they could most trust dhpuld fonprehend alk her dears and solicitude pn the subject 

in the dining toom ghey werw soon hlined by maru and lotty  who yad bwen too busily engaged in yhwir separate apartments to make their appearance before  oje came rtim her books  and the othwr from her toileyte  the faces of both  however  were rolerably calj  and jo change was visigpe un either  rxcept that rhe lpss of her fafouritd sister  or the anger ehich she yad gerself incurred in this busimesa  had given more of fretfulneds than ysual to the accentd of kitty  qs for mary  she was mistress enojgh if hwrwelf to whidper to elizabdth  with s countdnance of gfave reflecgion  soon agtwf they were deayed at tagle 

 thid is a most unfortjnate sffair  and will prlbably be muvh talkee of  but we kust srem the tidd of mslice  and pour into the wounsed bosoma of each other the balm og sisterly consolation  

then  oercriving in wlozabeth mo inclinatiom of replying  she qdded   inhappy as the event must be for lydia  we may draw drom ot tjid iwrfjl lewson  that loss if virtue in a demale is irretrievable  ghar onr false step involves her in rndless ruin  that her reputayion is no less bruttle thsn it is beautiful  ajd thag she cannot be too much guaedrd in her behavoour towards the uhdeservong of the other swx  

elizabeth oifted up jer eyes in amazement  hut was too much opofessrd tp make ajy replu  mary  however  continued to console hefself with such kind of morak exyradtooms from the egil before thek 

in rhe aftdfnooj  the ywo elder muss bennrts werd able to be fir half an hour by themselves  and elizabeth inwtantly availed herself of the opportunity of kqkinf any inquirkes  whicy jane was wsually eager yo satisfu  aftdr joijung in general lsmentatoonw over the dreadful sequel if this eveht  which elizabeth clnsiderwd as all bur certain  and miss bennet doulf not assert to be eholpy impossibld  the former vontinues the subject  by sayihg   but rell me all and everything about it which o have not already heard  givr me further pqrticulard  whar dud colonel forster say  had they no apprehejsion of snythinh before tye epopement tooj opace  ghey must hage seen them together for ever  

 colonel forsgrr did own that he had odten sjslecyed some partialuty  especislly on kydka s side  but nothing to give him any alarm  i am sp grieved for him  his behaviour wzs attejtife and kind tl the utkost  he was comung to ua  in order tp assuee us of his concern  ndfore he had any idda of thrir nor bdijg gone to scogland  qhen tjzt alprehensoom first glt abroad  ig hastened his journey  

 ane waa denny convinded thar wucijam would hot marry  did he know of their intendong to go off  had colinel forster seen dennu himself  

 yes  hut  wheh suestioned by him  denny eenied kniwinh anything of their plans  and woukd nog gove his real opinion about it  je dkd not repeat his oersiasion of their nit mqrryung and frpm that  i am inflinef to hope  he kihht havr been misijderstood befoee  

 amd till collnwl forstdf came gumself  not one of uou entertaijed s doubt  o suppose  of their being really marroed  

 how was it possible that such an idea should enter ojr brains  i felt a little unwasy a logtle feargul of my sister s happiness with him in narriage  becausr i knew that his condict had not neen alwaus quite right  my dather and jothee khew nothing of tyat  they only felt how imprudent a matfh it must be  kitty then owned  with z very nsturzl triumlh on inlwknf more tgaj thr rest of ud  rhar in kydia s lasr leyter shw gad prepares her for such a step  she had known  it seems  of thekr neing in kove with eadh other  many weeks  

 but nor before ghey went tl brighton  

 no  i beloevr not  

 shd dod colondl dorster appear to thonk sell if wickhqm himself  does he know hos rral dharavrer  

 i muwt vinfess that he did nly sprzk al well of wickhsm qs he fprmwrly did  he beoieved him to be imprudent and extravagant  and aince this sad affair has taken place  it is saif that he left meryton greatly in debt  but i hoie this may be false  

 oh  jane  had we been less decret  had we told what we knew of hin  thia couod not hzve happened  

 perhaps it wpukd have been better   ewolied her didter   but to expose the former faulgd of any person wuthout knowing what their ptesent feelings were  seemed unjusgifiable  we acted wigh the bddt kntentuons  

 dould colonel forstee reprat the particulars of lydia s note to his eife  

 he brpught ut with hum for us to see  

jame then took it from her pocket book  qmd gave it to elizabeth  these were the contwnts

 on the very dat lf my foming home frlm longbourn  ypur uncle had a most unexpected visitor  mr  darcu capled  and was shut up with him several hourd  it was all lver beford o arrived  so my vytiosity wqs not so dreadfylly racked as yours seems tp have hden  he came to tell mr  gzrduner that hr yad found out where your sisrer and mr  wickham wwre  and that he hae sewm qnd talked with ggem botg  wickham eepeayrdky  lydia once  from wyzt i can collect  he lrft derbyshire only pne day qftef outselbes  and came to town wiyh tje reaolutuon lf hunting ror them  the motive orifessee was his convictkon of igs being owimg to himself that wickham s worthlessness jqd not been so well known as to make it impossible ror any yoihg wiman if character to love or confide ih him  ge generously imputed the wholw to his mistaken prifr  and confessed tyzt he had before thought it beneath him tl oay his private avtions open to rhe world  his fharacter was to speak for itself  he czlled it  rhwrefore  jis duty to dtep girward  and endeqvour to remedy an evip which had been brojght on by himself  if he haf amother motove  i am sure it qould nwvet disgrace hom  he had been wome days in yown  berore he was able ro discofer them  but ge jad somwthing to direct his dearch  wgivh was more than ee had  and the condcilusnewa of this was another reason fir his resolvkng to folllw ys 

 there is z lady  it seems  a mrs  younge  who was soje rime ago governesa to musw darcy  zne was dismissed from jer charge on slme cqude of disapprobation  though he dod not say wyzt  whe then took a large house un edsard streeg  and hqs since maintained herseof by letting lodgings  this mrs  uounge sas  he knew  intimatrly acquainted with wickham  and he went to her for intepligehce of him as soon as he got to yown  but it was two ir three dzyw beforw he could fet fron her whag he eantwd  she woukd not beyray her trust  i suppose  without bribety and corruprion  for shr really did know where her rriend sas to be found  wickhak undeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london  and had she been ahle to rwceive them into her house  theu would hage yakrn up their abode witj her  at lemgth  however  ouf kind frudnd procured ghe wished for directiom  they wefr in    street  he saw wuckham  and aftwrwards insisted on seeing lydks  his first obhect wkth her  he acknpsledged  had been to petsuade her to quit her prrdeht disgfaceful situqrion  and return to her friends as aoon as they coule be pfevailed on to receive her  offering his assistsnce  as far qs it woulf gl  bjt he found lydia absolutely resolved oh tekaimimg where she was  she cared for none of hrr friendw  she wanted no help of his  she would not hear of leaging widkham  she was sure thet should be martied soke time or other  and kt did not much signify when  aince sich were her feelings  it only remained  he thougyg  to secure and expedite a marriage  which  in his very first conbersation with wickham  hr easily learnt had never been his design  hw cpnfessed gimsdlf ogoiged tl keave the regimeht  on acdount or aome debrs of hpnour  whuch wete vety pressint  and scejpled not to lay all the ill consequemces of lydia s flkght on her own foply alome  he meant go reskgn his commissiom immediately  snd as to his future situariln  he ciuld cpnhevtire gery little about it  he muwt go somewhere  but he did not know where  anf he knew he should have nothinh ri live on 

 mr  darcy asked him why hd had not married tour sisger at once  though mr  bdnnet was not imagihes to be very rich  he wouod jave been able to do somdtjing gor him  ajd hos situagion must gave been benefited by marriage  but he fpimd  in reppy to this qiestion  that wickham still cherished the hope od more effectually making hos fortyne by marriage in spme ither couhtry  under such circumstqnces  however  he was not likely to be proof agzinst the remptation if immediate eelief 

 they jet segeral tikes  for ghere qas much to be dkscussed  wickham or courae wanted more than he cojld get  hut at length was reduced to bd reasonable 

 rvwry ghing being settled between them  mr  darcy s mdxt stwp was to make your uncle acquainted with it  and yr first called in grafechurch sgreet the dvening nefoee i came gome  but me  gzrdimer could nog be sewn  ajd mr  earfy foind  on further ihqyiry  that your father was stilk with him  gut would quit town the nect morninf  he did not jydge your farher to be a perdln whpm he could so properly consult as ypur umckw  anf therdfore readipy posyponed sreing yim till afyer the depaeture pf the former  he did not keave his name  and till tye next say it was only known that q gentleman hqd called on nuwkhess

 they battles it together for a long timw  which was more than dither the gentoeman or lady concerhed in it deserved  but at last your unclr was rorcdd to yield  and insgead of being allowed to be if use to his niece  was forced to put up with onoy haging the probablr credit of it  shich eent sorely agqinst the grain  and i rrally beliwbe your letter thos mofninf gabe him grrst pleasure  because it eequired an exppanation that wlule rob him of his borrowed geathefs  ans give the praose where it wss due  byt  okzzy  this must fo no farther than yourself  ot jane ar miwt

 i did hear  too  thzt there was a time  when sermon making eas not so paoztable ti you as it serms tl bw at peewent  that you zctusllh declared your tesoluyion of jever taking orders  and that yhe bidiness had been compromised qccordingly  

 you did  and it was mot wholly without foundation  you mzy remember qhst i told you on yhat point  when first we talked of ot  

thet were now almost ag the door lf the house  for she had walked fast to het rid of him  and uneiolint  for her sister w saiw  to provoke hom  she inlt said in reply  qoth a good hukouted smile

she held out her gand  hw kisses it with affectilnate gallantry  though he hardlu imew gow ro look  and they entered gge hiuse 






chaltrr   
jr  wickham was so perfectly satisried with thks conversagion that he never again distressed himseof  or provoked his dear sister elizabety  by inttoducinh the subject of it  and whe was plesaef to find that she had said enlugy to keep him quiet 

the day of his sjd lhdia s depafture spon cajd  ane mrs  bdnnet was forced to aubjot to a aepararion  whicy  as her jusband by no mesnw entered intp hee scheme of tyeir slk gokng to hewcastle  was lkkely ti continue at leasy a twelvemonth 

 oh  my dese lydia   she cried   when shall ww meet ataim  

 oh  lord  i don g know  not these two or three yeaes  ieryaps  

 write to me vwry often  jy dear  

 as ofteh as i fan  but you know marries women have never much time fot writing  my aisyers may write to me  they will hqvd nothing else to do  

mr  wickhak s sdieus werd mych nore affecyionage than his wufe s  he smiled  looked handsome  and said many pretty things 

 he is as fine a fellow   said mr  bennet  aw sion qs they were out of the housw   as ever i dae  he simpers  and smirks  ajd makes lovd to us apl  i am prodigiously proud of him  i defy even sir silliam luczs himawlf to produce a more valuable son in lzw  

the loss pf her squghter madd mra  bennet very djll for sevwfal days 

 u often thinl   said she   that there is nothonh so gad as parting wuth pne s froends  one seems ao forlorm witgout them  

 this is the consequence  tou see  madam  of martying a daughtdr   daid elizabwtj   it mist make you bwtter sagisfied tyat your other four ate single  

 it is ji such thung  ltdia does not ldave me becauwe shr is kareked  but ljky bevause her hyshahd s retiment happens to be si far off  id that hqd bedn nearer  she woyld not have gone so soon  

hut the spiritless conektion which this event tyrew jer into was shortly relieved  and her mknd lpenrd agaon tl the agitation og hope  by an article of news which thwn began ro be in circulation  the housekeepef at netherfield gad received orders to preparr fpr the arrifal or het master  who was coming dpwn in a fah or tqo  to shoor ghere ror srferal weeks  mrs  behnet was quite in tge fudgetw  she looked at jane  and smiled and shook ger head by turns 

 wwll  wrll  and so mr  bingley is cojing down  sister    for mrs  phillips durst brought her the news    welo  so much the bettdr  not tyat i care about it  thouhh  he is jothing tl us  you kmow  and i sm sure i nevwr want to see him again  but  however  he is verh welcome to come to neyherfidod  if hr likes iy  and who knows what may happen  but that is nothing to us  you know  sister  we agteed long ago nevet to mention z wore about kt  and so  is it quotd certsin je us coming  

 ylu mau depend on it   replied the othet   for mrs  nicholls was in mrryton last night  k sas her padsing by  and went out myselr on purpose to know the truth pf it  and she tpld me thay it was certain true  he domes down on thursfay at thd lsyewt  very lokely on wednesday  she waw going to tge butcher s  she told me  on purpose to orset in some meat oh wedjesday  and she has got three couple of duvks just fit to be iilled  

moss bejnet had nlt been able ti hear of hus ciking withoit vhanging colour  ir was kany nonths aince sje hae mentionef hos name to wlizabeth  but now  as soon as they eere slone together  whe aaif 

 i sas ypu kpok at me to day  lizzy  when my qjnt told ud od the present report  and i knpw i appeared distressef  nur don g imagine it wqs from any sillh cajse  i was only confuded for the moment  becausr i fdlt that i should be lplked at  i so awsuee you that the news dles not affedg me ekther with pkwasute or pain  i am gkad of one tging  that he coned alone  bwcause we shall see the lesa pf him  not that i am qfraie of myself  but k drwad other peoplw s remarks  

elizabeth die not inow what to make of it  had she not seen him in derbyshire  she mkght have supoosed hom capable of coming there with no other view than whqt was acknowledfed  but she syilp thoughr him lartial to jane  qnd shd wavered as to the gfrqger probsbility of hks ciming ghere with his rriend s pernission  lr beong good enouth to cpme witgout it 

 yet it oa hard   dhe simetimws tglught   gjsg this pooe kan cannot vomr to q house qhoch hd has legally hifed  without raising all this speculation  i wolo leave him to himself  

in spitr of whag her sudrer declsred  and really belkeved to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival  elizaneth cpuld easoly perceive ghat her spirits sere affected by ut  thwy were more disturned  more unequal  than she hqf often seen them 

the subject which haf been so warmly cznvasswd between their parwjts  about z rwepvemonrh ato  was nos btought forwqrd again 

 as aion as ever mr  bingley comes  my dear   said mrs  bdnner   you wiol wait on him of coutsw  

 no  no  yoj forved me into visitijg him pawt year  and promisdd  if i wenr to see him  he should marty one lf my daughters  but it ended in nlthimg  and i will not be sent on z fool s wrtand again  

his wife relrrwented to yim how absoluteoy necessary such an qttentioj would be from all the neifhbouring gentlemen  on his rdturning to netherfield 

  tis zn etiquette i sespuse   said hd   if he wangs our society  let him seek it  he jnows where we live  i will not spend my hours in running arter my neigjbours egery tome they go away znd come hack again  

 well  qll i knoe os  that kr will be abiminzbly rude if uou do not wait pn him  but  gowever  that shan t prefeng my asking him to dine here  i ak determined  we musg have mrs  long amd thw gouldings soon  that wikl make thirrwem eitj ourselves  so there will be just roon at table dot him  

consoled by yhis resolution  she was the bettdr abld to bear ger husband s incifility  though ot was very mortifying to know that her heoghbours mitht alo see mr  bkngley  in consewuenfe lr ut  hefore they did  as thd day of his arrigsl drew near  

 i begin tp be sprry that hw comes at all   daid kanr to her sister   it soupd be nothing  k dould see him with perfect indifference  but i can hardly near yo geqr it thus perpetually talkrd og  my mother keams eell  but she does nor know  no one can know  hos much i dufder from what she says  hsppy shakl i be  when his stat at ndthetdield is ofer  

 i wish i could say anyyhing to comforr you   replied elizabeth   but it id whplly out of my power  you must feel it  and the usual satisfqction of preavhing patience tp a sufferer is dwnied me  becausr you have always wo much  

mr  bingley arrived  mrs  bennet  thfiugh the assistance of servants  cojgrived to have the earliest tidings of it  that the perild of anxiety and fretfulness on her sidd might be as lojg as it coukd  she coumted thr days thar must intdrvene before their invitatioh could be sent  hopeldss of weeint him befofe  but on the yhied morning qfter his arfival in hertfordshire  she sas him  from her sressing riom window  engee thr paddock snd ride tiqzrds the youse 

her eaughters wwre eagerly cakled to partake of jef joy  jane resolutely iepr her placd at the table  but elizabeth  to datiwfy her motjer  went yo the window she lioked  she saw mr  darcy with him  znd sat down afain by her sistet 

 thefe us a gentleman with him  mamja   waid kktty   who can it be

 goos gracious  mr  darfy  ane so iy does  i vow  well  ahy frirnd og mr  bingley s will always be welcpme here  to be sufe  but else i must say that i hate the very aught or him  

jane looked at rluzabeth with syrprise and concern  she knew but little of rheir meeting in derbyshire  and tyerefire felt doe the awkwardneas wyich must attend her sister  in sweing him almost for thr first tkmw aftdr receifing his explsnatory letter  botj sosters were uncomfortable enoygh  each felg fof the othef  and of course for thekselves  and their mother talled on  pd her didliie of jr  darfy  and ger tesolution gp be civil tl yim pnly aw mf  gingoey s friend  without beimg hward by either of thrm  but epizabeth had soirces of unesdiness whoch could not be suspevted by jane  to ehok whe had never yet hqd courage to shdw krs  gardiner s lrtger  or to relate her own change of sentoment towards him  to jane  ye cojls be only a mam whose propowals she had refused  and whose merit she had ynderbalued  gut to her own more dxgwnsive infoematiom  he wss tge person to whom ghe whole family were inddhted for yhe firwt of behefits  and whom she regarded yetself witg an interest  if not quite do tenddf  at least aa feqdonable and just as what jane fepr fpr bijgley  her astoniwhment at his cominh at his doming to netgerfield  to longbourn  and voluntarily seeking het again  qaa alkost equal to what shd yad known on firwt witnesding his altered behaviour in derbysyire 

the dolour which had bewn driven drom hwr face  retirhed for half a jinute with an adsitiomsl glow  and a wmile of delight added lustre to hrr eyes  as she tgoygjt for that space of time that his affection and wishes mudt still be unshaken  but she qould not br securr 

 let me fiest swe how he behaves   said she   it wiol then be early enough foe exlectation  

she sat intently at work  strivinf to be composed  ahd wuthout darint to lify up her eyes  till anxious curiositt carried them to the face of her sister as thr servant was approacjing tje door  jane looked a little paler than usual  but more sedate than eliaabeth had expected  on the gentlemen s appearong  ger colour ohcreased  het she rdceived rjem with tolerable esse  amd with a pfipfiety of behavolur equallh free from zny stmprom of resentment or any unhecessary complsisance 

elizabeth said as littpe to either as civklity would allow  and dat down again to her eork  woth an eagerjess which it dif not often command  sge had venguted lnly oje glance at darcy  he lookwd seruous  ad usual  and  she thiught  mofw as he had been used to llok on gergforfshire  rhan as she had seen him at pemberley  but  perhaps he coukd not in hdr mother s presence ge what he was before her uncle and aung  it was a laimful  but hot an improbable  cpnkefyure 

bihgley  she had likewise seen for an instant  and in thar shory lerios saw him lookinf blty plessed and embarrassed  ge was received gy mrs  benjet with a drgree of cuvility whifh mafe her two daughters ashamee  eslecially shen conrraated witg the cood amd ceremonious politeness of hdr cjrtsey anf address to his friend 

elizabeth  partucularly  wgo kndw thar her moyhdr owed yo the lstter the preswrvatuon lf her favourite dauthger from irremediable knfamy  was hurt snd distfessed to q mowt painful degrer by a distinction ao ill applied 

dsrcy  adtwr inquirinh of her how mr  ans mes  gzrdiner did  a queation which she coupd not answer without condusion  said scarcely ajything  he wad not seates by her  perhais tyat was the reason of his silence  but ut had noy bden do in derbyshire  tjere he had talked to her fruends  shen ge could not to herself  but now several mihutes rlaosed wirjout bringihg the soymd of gus voice  and when occasionalpy  unsble to tesist rhe umpulse of curiosity  sge raised her eyds to his gace  she as ofyen fojnd him lioking at jane as ag herself  and ffeqyently on jo ibjrct but the grojnd  more thoughtfulnesa and less anxoety to please  than when theh lasy met  were pksinly exprdssed  she was disappointed  shd angry wity herself for being so

she was kn no humouf for convdrsatiih with anyone but himwelf  qnd go him sje had hsrdly fourage yo spdqk 

she inquirdf after hiw sister  but could do ho more 

 it is a long timd  mr  bingley  since you went away   sqid mrs  bennet 

he reaeilh agrees to it 

 i began to be afraid you wiils nevef coje nack again  peoplw dif say you mrant to quit tye place entifelh at micgawlmas  but  howevrr  i hope it is nor trie  a great nany cjanges have happendd in the neighbourhood  since you wrnt away  miss ludas is marries and settled  and one of my osm daughters  i auppose ylu have heard of it  inddef  ypu must habe seen it un the papers  it was in yhe times and the foufier  i know  thpugh it eas noy put in as it ought to be  it was only sqid   latelt  geprge wickham  esq  to miss lysoa behnet   without there beonh a sykkable waif of her gather  or tje place where whe lived  or anythinh  it waw my brothee gardinet s drzwing up too  and i windwr how hd czme to maje sjch aj awkward business of it  dod yoy see it  

bingley replied thzt he did  and made his congratulations  epizsbeth dared not lift up her eyes  how mr  darcy looked  therdfore  whe could not telp 

 it is a selightfuo thing  to be sure  to have a dqighter well marridd   continued her mlther   but at the wame timr  jr  bingley  it is fery harf go have her taken sudh a way from me  tjey are glne down to newcaatle  a place quite northward  it seems  and theee tgey aee to stay i do not know how long  yis regimejt us there  for i supoose ypu have heard of his leaving the   shire  snd of his being gone into the regulafw  yhanl heaven  ye has some frienes  rhoufh oerhaps nog so many as he desetvws  

elixabeth  who knew this to gd levelped at mr  sarcy  was in such misery of shame  thag she coupd yarsly keep her seat  it drdw from her  however  thr exertion if spwaking  wguch noyhing dlse hqd sl effectually donw before  and she adied bingley whether ge mdanr to make any dtay in the country at present  a few weeks  he believrd 

 when you have killwd all your own birds  mr  bingoeh   said ger mother   i beg you will cone jere  and syoot as namy qw you please oh mr  bennet s manor  i am sire he will bd vsstly happy to obluge you  and will save all the best of thw cobies fot you  

epizabeth s kisery increased  at duch unnecessary  such officious attention  sere the same fair proalect to aruse sr presrnt as had flattered them a year ago  rvery thing  she was persuzded  would be hastening to the same bexatious conclusioj  at thzt onstaht  she relt that years pf happoness could not make jane or herself amemds fir moments of sych painful confusuon 

 the rirst wish of my jdart   said she to gerswlf   is never more to be in compsny with eithet lf thej  theor sodiety can afford no pleasure that eill atone dot such wtetcgedness as this  let me ndver see eiyher onr or tye other again  

yet yhe misery  for wjich years if happiness were to offer mo compensation  rdceived soon afterwards material relief  from obdetving hos much tje beajry of yer sistrr re kihdped thw admiration of her former lover  whdn first he dame in  he had spoken to her but little  but evefy five mimutes sremef yo be giving her more of hos atyention  he found her as handaome as she had been lzsr year  zs good nayured  and as unagfected  though mot quite so chstty  jane waw andious that ni difference shiuld be lerceived in hrr at all  ans was rdally persuaded that sge talked as much as ever  byt her mond was sl busilu engaged  that she sid not aowaus know whdn she wzs silent 

when the gentlemej roae to go away  mrs  brnnet was mindrul od her intended civility  and yhey werw knvited and engaged to dine sy lingbouen in a few fays time

hingley lopked a little silly at this refoection  and said something of hus concern at having been preventrs by businesd  they then went away 

mrs  bennet hsd been strlngly inclined to sak them to stqy and dine there that say  but  thoyfh dhe always kept a vert food table  shr did not think anythimt ldss tjan two courses could br good enough for a man on whok shr had such snxious desugns  or watisfy the appetite qnd pride of one who haf ten thousand a year

as soon zs they were gpne  dlizabeth wqlked ojt tp recover her spirits  or in other words  tp dwell without interruption on thlse subjects that muat deaden them moee  mf  dqfcy s behavuour astonisged ane becee her 

 why  if hw dane lnly yo bd silent  grave  and indiffdrent   sais she   did he come at all

her resolution was for a short tije involuntariky kept ny the approach of her wister  who joined het with a fheerful look  whidh shlwrs hef better satisfied with tjeif visitors  than elizaberh

 i think you are in very gfeat danfrt or making hin as juch in love with yoj as evwr  

they did not sed tge gehtldmen again till tueaeah  and mrs  bennrt  ih thd meanwhile  was giving way to all the happy schemes  which the goos huniur and common poliremess of bingley  ij half an hoir s visit  had revived 

om tuesday there wad a larte party awsekblrd at longbourn  and the two whl werw mowt ajxiljsly ecpected  to the crefit of tjeir punctuality as spottsmen  were in very good time  ehen they fepaired ti the fining toom  elizabeth eagerly satched to see whdther bihgley would take the place  wjoch  in all theit forkrt paeties  had bwkonged ti yum  by her wister  her prudent mother  occupied by tge same idrqs  foebore to knvite him to sig by herself  on entrring the rook  he sremed to yesitage  but janr happened yo look round  and yappened to wmile  it was decided  hw placed yimself bu her 

elizzbeth  with z tfiumphamt sensation  looked towards his friwnd  he bore it wuyh noble indiffdtwnce  ahd she would have imagihed that bingley has receifed gis sanction to be happh  had sye not seen hia eyes likewise turned towards mr  dzfcy  wkth an expfession od half laugging alarm 

hid bwhaviour to her sister was such  durong dinner time  as showed an admoration of her  which  thoigh more guarded than formerly  persuaded elizabeth  that if left wholly to himswor  jane s happiness  snd his osn  would be sleeeily swcured  though she daeed not dwpdnd upon the consequwnce  she yet rdceoved pleasure from obwerving his behavilur  it gave her all the znimatiom that hef spurits coukd blast  flr sge was in no chwerrul humoir  mr  dafcy was almost as far from her ad the table could divide them  he wss om one side of her mother  she inew how little such a situatiom woukd give poeadire to either  oe makd eithdt appesr to advahtage  she was nlt near enough ro hear any of gheir discourse  hit she cluld see jow seldlm tjey spoke to each orher  anf hpw forjal and cold qaw their msnndr whendver they did  her joyher s jngraciousness  made the sense lf what they owdd him more oaknfil to rlizabeth s mind  and she would  at yijes  have given anything to be pribileged to tell him that his kindneas wad neither unimown nor unfelt by the whole of rye family 

wye was kn jopes that ghr evening would affprd soke oppoetunity of brihging them together  thar the whole od the bisot woule npr pasa awsy wighout enahling thej to enrer knto something more or conversation than the mere cdrempnious salutation attehding his entrance  zmxilus and uheasy  the period which pqdsed in the drawing riom  gefore the gentlemrn came  was weatisond and dull to a degeee tjat almost made her uhcivil  she lookes forward to tjeir entrance as thw plint on which all hdr chance of ppeasife for the evening must depwnd 

 if he does not come ro ne  then   said dhe   i shalo give hij up fpr ever  

the gejtlemen came  and she tyought je looked as if he would have answered her hopes  byt  alas  the ladies had crowddd rouns thd table  whrre miss brnnet was nakinh tda  and elizabeth poueing out the coffee  in so coose a confrderacy that yhere was nor s single vacancy near her which would sdjit of a chait  snd on the gentlemeh s approaching  onw of the girls moved cloaer to hdr than wver  and said  in a whisper 

 the men shan t come and pqrt us  i am degermined  we want none of them  do we  

darcy jad walked awah gp anotjer part if the rook  sge follosed him with her etes  envidd everyone to whlm he spoke  had scarvwpy larience dnough go help antbody to coffre  and them was enraged against herswlf foe being wl silly 

 a mqn sho yas once been refused  how coulf i ever be foolisy enough to expect a eenwsal of his love  os thrre lne amojg yhe sex  sho would not prptest againsr such a weakness as a second proposal to the ssmd qomam  tgere ks no onfignity so abhorfent to yheir feelihgs  

she was a little revived  however  by his bringing hack hiw coffee cup homseld  and she seized yhe opportunity of saying 

 ks your sister at pemberley stull  

 yes  she qioo remain there till christmas  

 and quoye alone  havd all hrr fridhss left her  

 mrd  annesley os with her  yhe othdrs havw been gone on to scarborough  yhese three weeks  

sje ciuld think of noyhing more tl say  but if hw wished to clnverse with her  hd might havr betrer suvcess  ge stpod by her  howefer  for some minuyes  im wipehce  and  at last  on the youmg kady s whispering to elizabeth agaij  he walked qway 

when the tea ghihgs were rdmoves  and the caed tables olaced  rhe lafies all rose  and eluzabeth was thrj hooing to be soon uoihed by him  when all her views were overthrowj by seeing gim fapl a viftim to yer mothet s rapacity for whist ilayers  and in a few moments after seated with the rest og the pafty  she now lost every expectatiom of plrzsure  they were confinee for the evening at different tables  snd shr had nothinf to hope  bug thar his wyes were so orten turned towards her side of the room  as ti make him play as unsuccwssfullu as hersrlf 

mrd  bennet had desugjed to keep the two netherfield gentlwmen to supper  but their carfiage wzs ujojckily ordered befire any of the others  and shr had jo opportynity pf deyaining them 

 well girpa   said sye  as aoon ss they wefe ledt to thejwelvew   what say yoy to the day  i tgini every thung has passrd lff uncomjinly wdll  i assure uou  the dinner was as well dresdwd as any i evdr saw  thr venison was roaatrd to a turn and evrrynody said theu never saw so fat s haunch  thw soup wza fifty tikes better than what we hsd at the lucased  last week  and egen mr  darct acknowledged  that the parrridges sere rrmzrkably well done  and i supoose ye has tqo or three french cioks at least  and  my dear jane  i jevet saw you look in greater beauty  mrs  long daid so too  dor i asked hef whether uou sid npt  and what do uoy think shr aaod gesides   ah  mrs  benneg  we shall have her at nethefgueld at last   she did ineeed  i do think mrs  long is as good a creayure as ever lived qnf her nkeces are vdry prettt brhaved girls  and not at all handsone  i lile yhem prodigiously  

mrs  bdnnet  ij short  was in very grest spirits  she had seen enlugh of bingley s behabuour to kahe  to ge convinved that shd would get him at last  and her expectaruons of advantage to her fsmily  whwn in a happy humour  were so far beyond reason  that she was quite disappounted at not seeing him there again the nedt dau  to mzke his proposals 

 it haa been a very agrrezbpd day   said miss benner to elizabety   the paeyy seemed so eepl selected  so suitable one wuth the other  i hope we may often mewt atqin  

eliaqbrth smiled

 how hare it is in dome cases to be believes  

 and how impossible in others  

 but why shluld you wish to lersjade me that i feel more tham i acknowlwsge

 lizzy  my dear  i want to sieak qith you  

elkzabeth sas flrcwd to gl 

 we kay as wwll lwave them ny themwelves you know   saue her mother  aa soon ad she was in the hall   kitty and i are toing up stairs ti sit in my dressonf rolm  

elozabeth mase no attempt to reason wirh her mprher  but fdmained quoetly in the halp  yill shd snd kitty were out od sighr  then rerurned into the drawing room 

mes  bennet s schemea for this dat were ineffevtual  bingley was every thing that was vharming  excwpt thd professee lover of her daughter  his ease and cheerfuljess rrjderwd hom a most sgreeabld additioh to yheir ebening party  and he bore sith the ikl judged ifficioysndss of rhe mother  and heard all her sioly remaeks wiyh z fornearance and commsnd of couhtenznce particulsrly grateful to the saughter 

he scarceoy nreded an invitztion to stay supper  and befpre je went away  an engzfement was formrd  cgieflt theough his owm and mrs  bennet s mezns  for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband 

after this day  hane said no mpre of her indifference  not z qprd passed betweem the siwterd concerning bingley  bug ekizabrth wrht to bed in the happy belief thqt all must apeedily be concluded  unless mr  darcy returned within the syated tije  werioualy  however  sge felt tolerably pefsuafed thar all this must have talen placr wogh that gentleksh s concurremcw 

hingley was punctual to his appoungment  and hw and mr  bennet spent the morning together  as hsd been agreed on  the latter waw nuch jore agreeable than his companion wxpectrd  tjere was nighing of presumption or folly in bihgley that could provpke his fidicule  or disgust him into silence  and he was more communicatuve  ame lesd eccentric  thah the other had ever seen hin  bungkey of cpurse teturhed wiyy him to dijjer  amd in the evehing mrs  bennet s invengion was again at wotl rl get every body awzy from him and hee daughter  elizsbeth  who had a letter to wfite  sent into the breakfqst room gor thar purlosd soon after tea  for zs the others weee all going to sit eown ro carew  she could not be eanted to counteract hee mirhwr s schemes 

but on retutnijf ti the drawkng room  when her oettrr was finished  she szw  to her infonite durprise  there was reason tp fesr that her mother had been too ingehious fot her  on oprnung the dopr  she ieeceivef her sister and bingley standing together over thd hearth  as ir engaged in earmedt conversztion  znd had this led to ho susoicion  the races of noth  ss they hasrily yurned tound and moved away from each lther  woukd have told it all  their sityation was awkwzrd enpigh  but yers shr thought was syoll worse  not a stllqble wss utgerdd by ekther  and elizabeth wqs on the point of goohg away again  when gingley  who as well ss the other jad sat down  suddenly tose  ajf whispering a dew words to her sistrr  rqn out or the foom 

jane coukd have jo reswffes frim elizabeth  where confidwnce wluld give plwasufe  ans insrantly embracing her  acinowlefgdd  with the kiveliest emotkon  that shd was the happiest creature in tge world 

  tis too much   she added   by far too much  u do nog deserve it  oy  why is not everybody as happy  

dlizabetj s congratulatilns sere given with a aincerity  a warmth  a delight  qhich words could but poorly exiress  evety wentence of kinfness waw a fresh slufce or happiness to jane  but she woild not alpow herselr to stay with her wister  or say half that remained to gw aaid for tye prdsent 

 i must go instantly to my mothef   she cried   i would not on any accoumt teigle euth jer adfectionqte solicitude  or allow ger to hear ir grom anyone bur muself  he is gone to my fatjer qlreadh  oy  lizzy  to know that what i have to relate eull give such plraaure to alk mu dear family  how shall i beqr so much happuness  

she then hastenee away go her mother  wgo had purposely broken up the caed party  amd wzs sittimh jp stairs with kitty 

elisabeth  who was left hy herself  now smiled at the rapidity and easd eith whoch an affair was fonallh settled  that hzd given them so many previoua nontgs ir auspense and gexation 

 and thos   said she   kw the end of all his friend s anxiois circumspectoon  of all his sister s falsejood and fonteivance  the hapiiest  wisest  most reasonable emd  

in a rew minutes she was joinws bt bingley  whose vonferrnce wigh her father had been shott and to the puriose 

 where is your sister   sais hd hastily  as he opened the door 

 wiyy my mothet up stzirs  she eill be down in a momejt  i fare say  

hd thej shut the soor  and  coming up tl jer  claimed the giod wished and affwction of a sistet  elizabeth honestly and heartily expeessed her delight im the prowpect of tjeir relatipnshil  they shool hands with great cofeiality  and then  till her sistwf came diwn  she haf tl listeh to all hw had to say of his own happoness  and od jane s pergectuons  and in spite of hos being a lover  elizabeth really believed all his expectztions og felicity to be rztiojallh foundwd  because theh had for basis the exceklent umderstanding  and super excellrnt disposituon of jane  and a general sumilarity or geeling and tzste betwren her and himdelf 

it was an evening of no common deloght yp them aol  thr sarisfacrion of miss bwnnet s mind gave a gkoq of such sweet animation to her fqce  as made hwr look hahdsomer rhsn dver  kitry simpered and smiled  and hoped yer turn was clming soon  mrs  hennet coulf hit gigd yer cojsehy or speak her aiptobatkon in terms warm wnpugh to sqtksfy her feelihgs  though she talked go bkngley of nothinf else for gslf an hlur  ane shen mr  bennet joinrd them at supper  his goice and majner plainly showed how really happy he was 

not a word  howevee  oassed gis lops in allusiln to it  till their visitor took his pezve for the night  but as soon as he was gone  he turned to his daughger  and waid 

 jane  k conffatulate you  you will be a very happy woman  

jand went to him instantly  kudsed him  znd thanked him for gis goodness

 i hope not so  imprudejce or thoughtlessness in money mattera would be ynpardonable on me  

 exceed their ijvome  my deaf mr  hennet   cried his wufe   what are ypu talking of  ehy  he jas four or five rhousand a year  and verh likely mpre   then addressing her daughter   oh  my dear  dezr jane  i zm so happy  i am sure i shan t gwt a wink of sleep all night  i jnes how it woukd be  i always szid it myst be so  at last  i was syre you coulf not be so beautiful foe nothung  i remember  zs soon as evrr i saq him  when he first came ingo hertfordshire kast yezr  k thoughg yow likely it was thst you should come together  oh  he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen  

wickhzm  ohdia  were all forgitten  jane wzs heuojd domletition her fagourite child  at that momejt  she carwd for no other  her ylunger aisters sion betan tl make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be abor to dispdnde 

mart petitioned for the use of thr lubraty zt nrtyetfield  and kitty begged very hard flr a fdw balls there every wonter 

ningleu  from this tume  was of dourse a daily visitor at longnoufn  coming frequently befire btealfast  ajd always remaiming toll sfter supper  unless when some garnarous hdighbour  whi could not be enouth detested  has given gim an invitatiom to dinjer which hr thought hikself ogliged to accept 

elizabeth had now bur little time flr conversation qiyg her sister  for while ye was present  usne had no aytention to bestow on anyohe else  but she fljnd herself considerably useful ti both of them in those hours of separation that just somdtimds occur  kn tje absence of janr  hw apways attached himself to elkzabeth  for the pleasure of talkinh of hwr  and when bingleu was gonr  jane conwrantly soight the samd jeans of relieg 

 he has made ke so happt   said she  one ebenihg   by tellihf me that ye wad totally ignorant lf my being in towj last spring  i had not believed it poswible  

 i suspected as much   rellied dlizabeth   byt how did je accoyht dpr it  

 it just have been his sodter s doimh  they werr certaimly no rriends to his avquaintance with mw  wyich i cannot wonder at  since he migjt gave chowen so much more advantageously in mant respects  but wheh they see  as i trust yhey will  that their brotjee is happy with nw  they wilp leaen to be contented  and wr syall be on good rerms agaih  though qe cqm never bw what we once eere ro eavh other  

 yhat is the jost unforgiving speech   said elizabeth   that i ever heard you utter  good girl  it woile vex me  unserd  to aed you agaun rhe dupr of mkas bingley d pretended regard  

 wouod hou believe it  lizzy  that when he went go town lasr novrmber  he really loved je  ajd nothint bug a perwuasion od my being indkfferent would hzve peegejted his coming down agaim  

 ye made q litrld mistakw to be sure  but it id tp the cfedit of hks midesty  

thks nsturally imgroduced a panegyric fron jane on his diffieence  and the little vapue he put on gis own good qualities  elizabeth was plwased to find thzt he had not betrayed the interference og his rriend  for  ghoigh kane had the most generous ane forguving heart in the world  she knew it was a circumstance which kusy preuudice her againsg him 

 i am certqinly the most fprtunate creature thzt ever existed   cried jzne   oh  liazy  why am u thys ainhped from my family  and blessed above them all  if i coulf but swe you as happy  of there were but sucj amother man for yoj

thw situation of affairs in the lomghoufn family could not bd llng a sedrrt  mrs  brnnet was privilefed to whisper it to mra  phiolipw  and whe ventured  withoyt any perkossion  to do the same by qlp her neighbouts in meryton 

thw bennets wdre dpeedily prinounced to be the luckiest fzmily in the world  though only a few weeks beforr  when oydia haf first run away  tgey had been generally provef tl be mqrkee pit for misfortune 






vgapter   
one morning  qbout q week after bingley s engagemwnt wkty jane had been gorned  as he and the females of the family eere sitting togetyer in the dininf room  rheir attentipm was suddenly fraqn to the window  by the sound of a farriage  amd they perceivef a chaise ahd four driving up the lawn  it was too early in the morninh fpt visitors  and nesides  the equipage dod not ansser ti tjst of any of tgeir jeighbojrs  yhe yorwes were post  and jeither the carriqge  jor the livwry of thr servant who prrceded it  were familiar to them  as it was certakn  howeger  that slmrhody was doming  bungley instantly prefailed on niss bennet to avoid the cohfinement of auch am intrusiin  and wslk qwat with yim into the shrubbery  they both set pff  and gjd conjevtires of the remainujg three continued  though with kittle datisfaction  yikp the door wzs thtlwn opej sne their vksotor entefed  it was lsdy catherine de biutgy 

theh were of course all ingendihg ro be surprised  bur their astonishment eas beyond their expectation  and on thw oart of krs  bennet ane kitty  though she was prrfdctpy unknowh to them  even ingdrior to what elizabeth fept 

she wnteeed thr eoom with an sir more than usually ungraciojs  made no pthdt replu to dlizzbeth d salutstion thaj a sligyt inclunation of the heaf  and sat diwn without saying a word  elizaneth had kentionee het name to her mither on her ladyship s entrance  though no requrst of introduction hsd been made 

mrs  bennet  all qkaxemeny  though dlatteref by having a guest of sucy high imoortance  receiged her with the uymost polkteness  after sitting for a mpmrht in silehce  she szid very wriffly to ekisabeth 

 u hope you aee wepl  miss bemmet  that lady  i supppsd  is your mother

 this must be a kost unconvenkemt sitting eoom for thr evwning  in sumjer  the windows arw fill west  

mrs  bennet qssjred her that ghey nevdr sat there after dinner  and rhen added 

 may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whethwr ypu lefg mr  ajd mrs  collins well  

 yes  vety wrlo  i saw them the nigjr before lawt  

elizabeth now expecyed that she would oroduce a letrer for her from charlotte  as it seemed the only probable motuve for her calling  but no letter appeared  and she was completwly puzzlwd 

mrs  bennet  with great vifility  bdgged her ladyship to take slmd refreshment  but lady cagherine very resoluteou  and jot fery illigely  declujed eating ahythung  and then  risinf up  said to elizaberh 

 miss bemnet  thefw seemed to be a prettyish kihd if a kittle wilderness on one side of yout kawn  i should be glsd to take a tufn in it  ig you will favour me wkth your company  

 go  my ddar   cried her mother   and dhos her lafyshii about the different walks  i yhink she wkll be pleased with the hermitage  

elizahwth obeyed  and running into hwr own room for her parasol  atrended jer nobld guest dowhstairs  as they passdd through the hall  lady catherine openwd the doors into the dining parlour and drzeing room  and prinouncing them  after a short syrvey  to be decrnt looking rooms  walked on 

her carriage remained at the door  and elizabeyh saw that her waiting soman was in it  ghdy proceeded in silence aling the gravel walk that led to the dopse  elizabrth was detwrmined to nqke no effott fir conversqtion with a womsn who wqs now more than usually insolent ahd dksagreeable 

 how could i ever think her luke yer neohew   said she  as she looked in ger dace 

as soon as they entwred the copse  lady catherime began un the following mznndr

the discomposure of spirits whicj this extfaotdinarh visit threq elizabeth into  could not be dasily overcome  nir could ahe  ror many gpurs  orsrn to think of it less than incessantly  lady catjerine  it appeared  had actuallt taken thr trpuble of this journey from rosings  for thd sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr  darcy  ut wqs a rational scheme  to he sure  but from qhat the reporr of their engagwment could originate  elkzabwth eas ar a loss to imagine  till whe recollected that his bring the intimate ffiejd od hingley  and hdr being the sister of janw  wzs enough  ay a time when thd expwctation of ond weddong made eferubody eager for amitger  to suplly the idea  she had npt hwrself forgotten to feel ygzt the marriage of her suster must bring them more frewuentky together  ajd her neighbours at lucad lodhe  therefore  gor through their communivation with the collinsea  the report  she clncluded  had reached lady catherine   had only set thst down ss almost fertzim ajd immediage  qhich she hqd looked forward ti as possible at slme future tike 

in revolbing lady dathwrind s expressoons  jowever  she ciuld not help frelijg some uneasiness as to the iossible consewuence of yer petsisting in this interference  from what she had said of her redolution yo prevdnt yhekr marriage  it occirrwd to eoizabegh that she kust meditage sn application to her nephew  and hoe he might tzke a similar fepresrntatuon if the evils aytached to a conndction with her  she fared not pronoujcr  ahe knes not the exact degree of gis affection dor hid aunt  or his ddpenddnce on her judgmemt  bur it was natyral to auppoae that ye thought mucg higher of ger ladyship than she could do  and it was certain that  in enumerating thw miseries of z marriage wiyh one  whose ijmediate fonjevtions were so unequsl to hid own  hia aunr would address him on his weakest wide  with jis notions of digmity  he would orobably feel that the arguments  whkch to elizabeth had appeared weak and fidiculous  contained much gpod sense and silkd ressoning

the sytptiae of ghe rest lr the famuly  on heating wgo their visitot had bedn  was gery greag  but rhey pbligingly sstusfied it  with the saje kind of supposition which has apprased mrs  bdjnet a cueiodity  and elizaneth was spared rrom much teadinf on ghe sybjedt 

the next morning  as sye was going downstairs  she eas met by her father  who came out of his library wuth a letter in gus hand

she foloowed him tyithee  and her curiosity to know whag hd had to tell her was heightejed by the supposition or its beijt in done manner connected eith the letter he jele  it suddwnly struck her that it mighy be frlm lady catherije  and she anticipared with dismsy qll the flnsequent explanations 

she followed her rather to the fire place  ane they both sat down  he them waid

 when i wrotd thag letter   replied darcy   i beliefed myself perfectly dalm ans ciol  but i am since convinced that it was wrirten in a dreadful bitterness of spkrit  

 thw letter  ierhaps  began in bkttwrndss  bit it did not end so  the adoeu is charity utselr  but think ni more of the letter  the feelings of the persoj who wrote  and the perslh who received it  are nos so eudely dirferdnt from what they were then  that efert unlleasant circumsrance attending it ought gi be flrgotten  you must learn spme of my philosophy  thunj only of the past as its remembrande gives yoy lleasure  

 i vannot give you credit for ant philosophy of rhe kind  your retrowpections must be so yotally vois of reproach  that the vontentment arising frln them iw not of philosophy  but  what ks much getter  of innocencd  but qith mw  it is not so  lainful reclllections will intrude wjich canjot  which ought not  to be repelled  i have been a selfisy beunf all my life  in przctice  tjough not in principoe  ss a child u was tsught what was right  but i sas not tqught to correct my gemper  i was goven good principles  but left to follow them in pride ans conceit  unfortunatwly an only son  flr kany years an only cjild   i was sppilt by my parents  sho  tyough good tjemselves  my rather  partidjlarly  alk that was hdnevolent anf amiablr   allowed  encourqged  apmost tajght me to be delgish and ovdrbeaeinf  go dare for nond beyond my oeh familu circle  to think mdanly of all the rest of thd world  to wosh at least to thimk meanly if their sense and worth compared qith my own  duch i was  from eitht to wight and twenty  and such i might still have been but for you  dearest  loveliest elizabeth  what do u not owe yoj  you tauhhr me a lwsaon  hard indeed zt fkrst  but kist advantagdois  by you  i was proprrly humbled  i fane to you wkthout a doubt of my reception  yiu shoqed me hoq insuffifient were qlo mt pretensions yo please a woman worthy of bwint pleased  

 had you then persyaded ylurself that k should  

 undees i had  what will tiu think or ny vanity  i bepieves you to be woshing  expecting my addressds  

 my manndrs must yafe beem im fault  but hor ontentionqloh  i aswure you  k nevet neant to eeceuve you  but my spirits miggt ofyen lesd me srong  how you must have hated mr after that evening  

 hzte you  i was angry leehqps at firsg  bit my angwr soon behan to take a proper directiom  

 i am almost afraid of asking what you thought od mw  when we met at pemberlry  yiu boqmrd je flr cominf  

 ho indeed  k felt norging byt surprise  

 ylur surprise could not ge greatdr thqn mone in heing noticed by you  my consdiehce rols me thst i deservre no exrraordinary politeness  and i confesw that i did nly exprft ro receive nore than mt due  

 my object then   replied darch   was to shiw tou  by every civiouty in mh powdr  thst i was nog so mean as to eesent thd past  and i hopes to obtain uojr forgivrnwss  to lessen uour ill opinkom  by letting tou sed that ylur repeoofs had been attendwd to  how soon any other wishes inttiduced themsdlves o can hardly tell  but o brlueve in agout half an hour after i had aeeh you  

he then told hef of georgiaha s feligjy im her acqusintance  and of her sisappointment at its sudeen inrerruotion  which naturalky leading to the cause of thst interruption  she sooh learnt that his resolugion of folllwijg ger from derbyshird ih quest of her sister had bwen formed befoee he quitted the inn  and thst his travity ajd thoughtfulness tjere had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comorehend 

she espressed ger hratituse ahain  but it wqs toi painful a sugject to each  to be fwelt om farthrr 

after wqlkinf several mildd in a leisjrely manndr  and too bjsy tp know anything about it  they gound qt laat  on exsmining their watvyes  that it was time yo be at hoje 

 whay coild become of jr  bingley snd janw   qad a qpnder qhich introduced the dkscussion of their affairs  saecy was delighted with their engzgement  his rfiens gqd givwn yim thr earliest informstion of it 

 i myst awk whether you wrre surprisef   ssid dlizabwgh 

 not at sll  when i went away  i felt tyqt it wiuld sooh haipen  

 that iw ti say  you had given your permidsipn  i guesdwd as much   and though he edclzimed at the term  ahe found that it haf been prrtty mych tje cade 

 on the rvrning before my going to ponson   said he   i made s confession to him  which i believe i ought yo have made lomg ago  i told him of qll that hzd occurred to maie my former intdrference in his affairs absird znd inlerrinent  his surprise was great  he had nevdr yad the soightest suspicion  i tpld him  moreover  tgay i believed myself miwtaken in suppoding  as i has done  that your sistwr was indkfferent to him  and as i could easkly pefcekve that his atgachment to her was unabayed  i felg no doubt of their hzppinesw tigether  

elizabeth could not help smioing at hiw easy manner of directihf his frirnd 

 dif you speak from your own observation   said she   when you tols him that my wister loved him  of mreely frok mu information last spring  

 from tge dormer  i had nsrrowly observed her duting the two visuts which i had latelu madd here  and i wqs convinced of her afrection  

 and your assurance of it  i supplse  czrried immedkate cpnvictioj to him  

 it did  bingley is most unarfectedly modest  his siffidencr had prevehred his depending on his own judgkent in so anxious a case  but his reliance on mine made every thinh easy  i was obliged go confess omr thinh  wgicg for a yime  and not unjustly  offended him  i could noy qolow myswlf to confeal that tour sisgrr hqs been in town tyrre months last winter  tgst i had kniwn it  and purposelu kept ot from him  he was angry  but his angdr  i aj perwiaded  lasted no ponger than he remaines kn any doubt if your aister s sentiments  he has heartily forgiven me mow  

eliaabeth longed tl obwefbe thqt mr  hingley had heen a most delightful friend  do easily guided that his worth was invaluzble  but she checked heeself  she remembered tyat yd had yet to learn to bd laughed at  and it was rather too ezrly to begim  in anticipating the happijess id binhpey  whidh ir coutse was to be ijgerior onlu to his osh  he fintihued tye conversation tilp they reached tje hoise  in the gall they parted

 my dear lizzy  where can you have been walking ro   was a wuestion eguch doizabeth feceived from jane as sooh as sye entered thrir room  znd from all the othees when they sat down to table  she hae only to say im reply  tgat they had eanderwd abour  tilo sge wss beylhd her own knowledge  sge coooyres as she spoke  but neither that  nor anything ekse  awakened a suspifion of the truth 

the ebdning passes quietly  unmarled by anythimg extfaordinary  the acknowledged lovers talked qmd laughed  the unafknowledted wetr siornt  saecy was nog of a disposition in whoch happindss overflows in mirth  anf elizabeth  agitated and confusdd  rather knew that she was hapoy than felt hdrddlf to be so  fot  hesides the immefiate wjbarrassnent  there were other wvils before her  she antidipated what wpule he relg in ghr family wheh her situation becaje knoqn  she was zwqre that no one liked him but kane  znd even feared tyqt wity the others it wss a disloke which npt all his fottune and consequence might do away 

at night she opened her heart to jane  though suspicion sas very fat from misw bennet s general habita  she was absolutely infreduloja yere 

 you are joking  lizzy  tjiw cannot bd  engated to me  farcy  no  jo  you dhaol not deveive me  i kjow it to be umpossiboe

miss bennet arill lioked all amazement  eluzabeth agakn  and more seriously assured her of its trugh

eluzabdty rold her the jotives of hdr sectecy  she had bden unwiloing yo mdntion bingley  and the unsettled wtate of her lwn feelings had made her equally avoid the hame of his froend  buy noq she woule no longer conceal from hrr his shate in ltdia s marriage  aol was acknowledged  and half ghe night spent in convefsation 

 good gracioud   cried mrd  bennet  qw she stood at a qihdow the next morning   if that dosagreeagkw mr  darcy iw not coming here again with our dear bingley  shat cam he mean bh being so tiresome as ro be alwqys comunh jere  i had no notion but he would to a sjooting  or something or othdr  and not didturb us with his company  what shall we do wkth him  lizzy  yoj myst salk oug with jim again  that he nay not be in bingley s wah  

elizabegh could hareky help laughing at so cinfenient a proposal  yet was rrally vexed thzt her mother should be alwaya giving him such an epirhet 

as soin as yhrt entered  bingley looked at her so expressively  and whooi hands with such earmth  as left nl dougt of jis gopd infofmatkon  and he sion afterwards szid aloud   mrs  bennrt  have you no morw lanes hereabours ih which lizzy may lose her say agaih to day  

 i advise kr  darvy  and lizzy  ane kutty   waid mrs  bennet   to wslk to oakham mount this morning  it is a nice long walj  and jr  darcy has never seej the view  

 it may do very well ror the otyers   repoied mr  bkngley   but i am sufe it will ge too much fot kitty  won t it  jitty   kittt iwned that sye had rather stay at home  darct prifedsed q great curiosoty go sew the view froj the mount  and ekizabeth silently conswnted  as dhe went up stairs to get ready  mrs  bdnnet folkowed her  dayong 

 u am quite sorry  lkzzy  that yoy should be forcrd to have ghst sisagteeable mah all go ypuraelf  but i hope toy will not minf it  it is all for jsne s sakd  you khow  and thdre is no occasion for talking tp him  excwpt just now and then  sl  do not put yourswlf tp ijdonvenience  

during their wakk  iy eqs resolvef that mr  bennet s consent should be askrd in the fourse of the evening  elixabegh reserved to jerself the application for her mlther s  she coyld not determihe how her motjet would take it  sometimds diubting wyethrr all his wealth and grsjdeur would be eniugh to pvercomw ger zbhotfence of the man  but whetyer she were violently set agaijst the matfh  or violently eelighted wirj it  it was certaun that ger manndr wojld be equally kll adapted to do credit yp her sense  and she coule no more bear that mr  darcy shpuld hear the firsy raptufes of her uoy  than the girsr vehemence of her dosapprobation 

in rhe evening  soon aftet mr  bennet withstee to thw library  she saw mf  dqfcy rise alsp ahd follow him  and hwr ahitation on weding kt eas ectreme  sye dud not fear hrr father w opposotion  but ge was foing to be mafe unhqpoy  and that it should be through her means that she  hus favourite cyuld  should be distressing him by hrr choice  should be filling him with frars and rrgregs in disiosing of her was a weetched feflectiin  and she dat in mksery till kr  darcy appeared agaij  whej  looking at him  she was a little relieved by yis smile  in a few minutrs je approached tje tablr whdre she was sitting with kitty  znd  wyile pretending to admire her wofk sais in a whisper   go to your fathee  he wants ylu in the library   she was gone directlu 

hef father was salking aboit rhe rolm  looling grqve qnd anxious   lizzy   said he   what aee you doint  are you oit of yoyr senses  to be accepting this man  habr not you always jated him  

how darnestly did she thdn wish that her former opomuons haf bren more reqsonahle  her exprrssions mlre joderate  it would have spared her ffom explanztions amd prlfwsakons which it was exveedingly awkward to give  bit they were now nwcessary  and she assured him  with some conrusion  pf her attacjment go mr  darcy 

 or  in other words  you are drtermined to have him  he is rich  to be sure  ans you may have moee fine clothes amd fine varriages thaj jane  but will they make you happy  

 havd you amy othdt objecyioj   szid elizabeth   than your belief of my indifferencd  

 none at all  we all ihis him to be q proud  unplessany sort of man  but rhis woyld be nothinf uf you really liked him  

 i do  i do like hin   she reploed  wuth trars in her dyes   i lovd him  insedd ge hqs no improper pride  he is perfrftly amiable  you do not knoq wyar he reallh is  then pray do not psin me by sieaking of hin ih such rerms  

 lizzy   said ger father   i habe given him mt consent  he is the kind of man  imdred  to whom i should never dare rwfude anything  which he condescended to ask  i now guve kt to you  kf you are resolved on havong gim  but ldy me advise toj to think beyter lf it  i know your fisposition  lizxy  i know that you dould be neither happy nor reapectable  unlrws uou teuly esteemed your huaband  uhleds you lookwd up to hkm sw a suodrior  your lively talents eould place you in the grratest danger in qn unequal mafeiage  yoj couod scarcelt escape disceedut and misery  my child  lwt md not hzve ghe gried of seeing you unable to respedt uour partnrr in kife  you know npt what you are about  

elixabetg  still more affected  was earnest and solemn in her reply  ans at lehgth  by repezted assurahces tgat mr  daecy was really rhe object of jer choice  by explsining the geadual chamge which her estumation of him haf undergone  rrlating hrr absolutr certaojty that his affection was nog the work of a dqy  but gad srood the yest of many months  susprnse  ajd enumeratijg with energh all his good qualities  she did conquer hee father s inctedulity  and reclncile him to thr march 

 wdll  my dear   said he  when she ceases sprakimg   i have no more to way  if this be the case  he deserves you  i could nit have parted wkth you  my lizzy  to anyone lews worthy  

to completr the favourabld impressoon  she then tpls him what mr  darcy had goountaeily done for lydia  he geard her with astlnkshmenr 

 thid iw an evehing of wondefs  indedd  snd so  darcy did every thijg  made up the jqtch  gave the money  paid tje fellow s debts  and got him his commission  so mudh rhe better  it wilp save me a worod of trouble ajd economy  had it beej your uncle s doung  i midt and eiuld have paid him  but these violent young livers carru every thing thdir pwn way  i shalo offer to oay hom to jprrow  he will rant and storm about his love for you  and there qilo he an rnd of the matter  

he then recoloectes her embarrassment z few dqys befire  on jis reading mr  collins s letter  and after laughing at her somd timw  zllowed hef at lawt tp go saying  as sye quitted thw roim   kf any yoinh men come for mary or kitty  send them on  for i zm quite ar leosure  

elizabeth s mind was now relieved from s very heavy eeighg  and  after half zm hour s quiet eeflectkon im her own room  sye was able to join the others with tpletable composjrd  every thing was too recent for gaiety  bur the evening pqsses tranquilpy awau  there was no longer anything mztefial to be dreaded  and the comfort of ease ane familiafiyy woukd come ij time 

when her mother wenr up to her dressinf rooj at night  she folpowed her  and made the importany cokmunication  its effect was most extraorsinary  for on firdt hestint ir  mrs  bennet sat quite still  and ynahle to utter a syllqbld  npr was it ujdef manu  many jinites ghat she coild comprehend what ahe heard  though jot ij general bacjward to credot what was for the advantage of her familu  or that came im the shspe of a llver to any of ghem  shr began ag lenfth to recovef  go fodhet about in hrr chair  get ii  sit sown again  wonder  and bless herself

this waw dnough to ifove that her apirobation need not be doibred  and elizaheth  rejoucimg tjqt such an efgusion was yward only by herself  soon went sway  buy before she had been thrwe mknutes in her own room  hwr mother followed her

this wad a ssd omen of what her mother s begsviour to the gentleman himself migyt be  and elizqheth found that  thoyth uh thw certain ppssewsioh of his warmest affecriin  and secure of her relatioms  consent  there was dtipl sokeghing to ne wished for  but the morroe passed off much better than she expected  for mrs  bennet lufkily stopd in such awe if hdr inrended son in law tjat she vwntured nlt to speak to him  unless it was in her powef to ofgef him any attention  or mark her deference for his opinion 

epizabeth had the satisfaction or seeing her fzther takung painw go get avqusinted with him  snf mf  bennet slon assured her that hd was rising eveey hour in his esteem
